## Technical Implementation

### Component Architecture
- **React Hooks**: `useState` for form state, `useEffect` for data loading and analytics
- **State Management**: Local state with TypeScript interfaces
- **Validation**: Client-side validation with real-time feedback
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error boundaries with toast notifications

### Design System
- **Chakra UI**: Production-ready component library
- **Custom Theme**: Brand colors and typography consistent with mockups
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with responsive breakpoints
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant

### Data Flow
1. **Load Questions**: Fetch from API route on component mount
2. **Track Responses**: Store user selections in local state
3. **Calculate Archetype**: Local scoring algorithm based on response mapping
4. **Submit Data**: Optional API submission with graceful error handling
5. **Display Results**: Show personalized archetype information

## Usage

### Development
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Building
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## API Endpoint Specification

### POST `/api/assessment/confidence`

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "responses": ["A", "B", "C", ...],
  "archetype": "analyzer",
  "startTime": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "completedAt": "2024-01-01T00:03:30.000Z"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "archetype": {
    "id": "analyzer",
    "title": "ðŸŽ¯ THE ANALYZER",
    "description": "...",
    "experienceLevel": "Beginner",
    "recommendedChallenges": ["..."]
  }
}
```

## Customization

### Adding New Questions
1. Edit `app/confidence-test/questions.v1.json`
2. Add question object with options mapping to archetypes
3. Update `totalQuestions` constant in component

### Modifying Archetypes
1. Update archetype definitions in `questions.v1.json`
2. Ensure scoring algorithm in component handles new archetypes
3. Update TypeScript interfaces if needed

### Styling Changes
1. Modify theme in `app/theme.ts`
2. Update Chakra UI component props in the main component
3. Maintain accessibility standards

## Performance Considerations

- Questions loaded once on component mount
- Local archetype calculation (no server round-trip required)
- API submission happens in background
- Static file caching for questions JSON
- Optimized bundle size with tree-shaking

## Security & Privacy

- No personal data collected without explicit consent
- Client-side processing protects user privacy
- Optional API submission allows for analytics while maintaining privacy
- HTTPS recommended for production deployment

## Browser Support

- Modern browsers with ES2015+ support
- Progressive enhancement for older browsers
- Mobile-responsive design
- Touch-friendly interface

## Deployment

The assessment is designed to work as part of a larger Next.js application. Ensure:

1. Environment variables for analytics are configured
2. API routes are properly deployed
3. Static assets are served correctly
4. HTTPS is enabled for production
