00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:15.920
Vasilii: Hi.

2
00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.170
Iso Rabins: Hello!

3
00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:22.139
Vasilii: Hello! Hello! Hello!

4
00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:23.399
Iso Rabins: What's up, man?

5
00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.580
Vasilii: One second, one second. Can you hear me?

6
00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:28.440
Iso Rabins: Yeah, I can hear you.

7
00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:33.442
Vasilii: Okay, okay, fine. How are you doing? Merry Christmas? By the way, again.

8
00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:35.849
Iso Rabins: I'm good man. Merry Christmas!

9
00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.069
Vasilii: Was, how was it going.

10
00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:54.109
Iso Rabins: It's going pretty good. Yeah, it's going pretty good, hey? So like it seems to be a little bit of a pattern that like we're missing meetings. You're late to meetings. And I need to be open that this is something that bothers me.

11
00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:55.380
Iso Rabins: So I.

12
00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:55.919
Vasilii: Of course.

13
00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:00.289
Iso Rabins: We need to like make meetings, and we need to be on time like, I work really hard to be on time.

14
00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:04.220
Vasilii: Yeah, of course, of course, sure, really.

15
00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:05.780
Iso Rabins: I just kind of agree.

16
00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:08.180
Iso Rabins: Expect the same respect back.

17
00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.220
Vasilii: Only a couple of minutes, but it's like.

18
00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:12.200
Iso Rabins: It's the principal.

19
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:12.520
Vasilii: Of course.

20
00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:13.650
Iso Rabins: Okay.

21
00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:16.520
Vasilii: Excuse me, excuse me, so much is gonna be the last time.

22
00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:29.679
Vasilii: So actually, we can, we can make the meetings, for example, every Friday, like 11 if it's like the same time as as we are right now. If it's possible for you, if it's convenient for you.

23
00:06:30.548 --> 00:06:39.340
Vasilii: the Friday is like the best time actually for me, if so not Fridays at 4, but still, like Fridays.

24
00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:40.260
Iso Rabins: Yeah, yeah.

25
00:06:40.528 --> 00:06:52.879
Vasilii: Yeah. And it's like, Yeah, I'm so really excuse me, but it's like a little bit like strange time. Because as I said, I'm like right now on the trip as you. By the way, the next Friday I will come back to the Belgrade.

26
00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:57.460
Vasilii: so I would like in full work potential.

27
00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:05.949
Vasilii: But maybe maybe let's schedule the next meeting right now to be on the point.

28
00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:11.019
Vasilii: to make it easier for everyone if it's possible.

29
00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:14.269
Vasilii: Cool. Yeah, that sounds good. Yeah, yeah, I can't even.

30
00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:14.610
Iso Rabins: And then.

31
00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:31.709
Vasilii: Can we? The next week, for example, meet at this at Thursday? I think it's it will be better, because on the Friday I think maybe I will be at the airport or something. So if Tuesday work for you, I will schedule the meeting right now.

32
00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:40.670
Iso Rabins: Okay, cool. Yeah, that sounds good. I'm not 100% certain when my schedule is, gonna be that day. But let's schedule it. And then we can change if we need to.

33
00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:47.360
Vasilii: Okay. Okay. Okay, yes. So excuse me again, I'm really, I really respect your time. Excuse me.

34
00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:53.460
Vasilii: thanks, man, it's it's yeah. It's my fault for sure. It's my, it's my fault.

35
00:07:53.710 --> 00:08:00.670
Vasilii: Hmm, so yeah. So let's jump into the project and into some ideas.

36
00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:04.730
Vasilii: because I want to show you something.

37
00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:07.699
Iso Rabins: Cool. Yeah, I'm excited to see what you got.

38
00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:11.790
Vasilii: Okay, I will share my screen.

39
00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:20.580
Vasilii: Boom! Boom! So one second let me get.

40
00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:28.919
Vasilii: Why, this widget is so big here, super inconvenient to work.

41
00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:31.089
Vasilii: So here it is.

42
00:08:32.397 --> 00:08:36.139
Vasilii: I'll check your idea. And can you see my screen right now?

43
00:08:36.563 --> 00:08:37.409
Iso Rabins: Yeah, yeah.

44
00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:43.649
Vasilii: I I've seen your idea, and really, actually like it with the check boxes.

45
00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:54.720
Vasilii: I really kind of like this idea. Only one thing here, I mean, just like, okay, the design. And IA little bit remake your design of it, but then.

46
00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:55.109
Iso Rabins: Yeah, yeah.

47
00:08:55.110 --> 00:09:10.480
Vasilii: Really cool to make the check boxes. It's really like the wish list or something about the projects. And it's really cool idea it's really fun. And I really like you. You made a lot of work actually to

48
00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:20.599
Vasilii: find the interesting colors here, too. So I play with them, too, to show to you how skin looks. So only thing with the checks boxes. So

49
00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:32.999
Vasilii: what I made I made here, like the few examples how it can be, in my opinion. The thing with the one check box like.

50
00:09:33.270 --> 00:10:02.829
Vasilii: For example, like this one, a little bit like more design, like a little bit more like application. I you know, I make this frame here. So when you, for example, put the check mark here, it's gonna be just like transition to another question, for example. But here it is with the check boxes. I realized it's a little bit more tricky than, for example, Slider, because not so many people, I think, will understand that you can actually click on this like a check box button and.

51
00:10:03.601 --> 00:10:17.206
Vasilii: This is a little bit tricky. That's why I make something like this once. It's more like a check boxes. And you can actually like understand that you can click on it, for example. But okay, we will. We will.

52
00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:35.870
Vasilii: take a look at this little bit later. So what I started to think when I was making this check buttons, I start thinking why we cannot, for example, asking the question, when, for example, you ask the question. It's more like, you know, call to action for the people.

53
00:10:35.870 --> 00:11:04.899
Vasilii: For example, we can make it from the question, like, want to build connection and get started. And here's a check button. So here you can, for example, for example, click on it already. The next one need AI software to stay on track, for example, ready to finish your dream project something like this. And I think it's more interesting one. And when the people will fill out and click on all check boxes. There's gonna be like welcome to Fridays at 4. 0, my God, there is a 2 s

54
00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:11.739
Vasilii: matter. And so yeah, welcome to Friday. So for support, for creative mind, and so on. Something like this.

55
00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:19.240
Vasilii: So my I really like the idea with the questions like a little bit, Paul, like on the Instagram or something.

56
00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:30.879
Vasilii: Yeah, I think it's more like playing full. I don't know. It's more interesting, more engaging, too. So the questions is, I think.

57
00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:54.808
Vasilii: for me, I don't know. What are you thinking for me? It's more like interesting approach to to this idea, and I play fonts here. I play with the funds a little bit, but still I don't like the funds that figma have. I think we can find our own funds, and I will do it to make it more interesting, more unique. And actually, I deleted and designed this

58
00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:21.240
Vasilii: footer the black one. I think the white ones look more stylish actually. And I play with another color. This one is actually looks really good, really like warm like sunflower. It's a little bit tricky. It's a little bit tricky to work with it, because it's super bright here. So if you're for example, using the white one here is already, like a little bit

59
00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:43.439
Vasilii: hard to actually connect the white. And this yellow color is just like disappear in this bright yellow. But actually, it's really like cool pattern. Maybe we can play with these 2 ones. So yeah. And I made this one. And I start thinking about the image. I got your idea with the image one.

60
00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:59.290
Vasilii: And I was thinking about what the kind of image we can put here, and I actually got the idea to put something about like Fridays at 4. Maybe it can be the clock. Maybe it can be the watches. Maybe it can be something like this, you know.

61
00:12:59.863 --> 00:13:27.820
Vasilii: Because it's like Fridays at 4, and still into the conception we can. I'm playing with this. And but I didn't have the time actually to create such an image. And on the Internet, I actually don't really like the images of the Internet. And this type of design of the watches, and because it should be something like Mailchimp, but more like I am filming. It should be like more like a line art or something

62
00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:41.960
Vasilii: to match our design or idea of the minimalistic style. But right now, I just like put. And this is my second idea. Put the iphone with the 4 Pm. On the Fridays. It's just like

63
00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:53.890
Vasilii: fun to make this poll. So I I mean, for example, it's just like example, how we can put some image here to make this, you know, space more unique.

64
00:13:53.940 --> 00:14:17.020
Vasilii: and to make a poll looks more like a poll. Actually, like a question poll in the Instagram, for example, ready to finish your projects, want to build connection with the supper. Boom, boom, click it and welcome. Friday, for example. And here can be the picture, not the iphone, but, for example, we can made our own picture of, for example, the

65
00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:38.880
Vasilii: watches, maybe, or something like this, something that's similar to the that match the vibe of the Fridays for the meetings. Maybe like 2 people, for example. Maybe they can be the free pictures that can changing. For example, people who are like having time. We're doing something creative the watches with the

66
00:14:39.260 --> 00:15:02.259
Vasilii: 4 Pm. On it, for example, or maybe calendar or something to measure the vibe of the application. But here's just like as an example. But I think it's it's kind of look, even with iphone kind of look cool and even I didn't try it. But I think here, with such design, we can even put this background here. And it's gonna look good.

67
00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:05.730
Vasilii: I think. So, yeah, so yeah, like that. Yellow.

68
00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:10.469
Vasilii: too too bright, too bright, like iphone right now, because actually.

69
00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:17.247
Vasilii: when we are like, trying to put something it should be in an environment. Because that's why, for example,

70
00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:41.760
Vasilii: our guys from time left, they actually made the photo shoot of the iphone and really like how they using this green colors and their background is kind of like material, you know, get little texture to it. So it looks more like unique, interesting. So we can do something similar. But the idea is kind of like this one.

71
00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:50.320
Vasilii: and in the Dev mode, which shows you how it looks like seconds.

72
00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:54.019
Vasilii: White. Yeah, something like this, for example.

73
00:15:55.050 --> 00:16:01.960
Vasilii: But like iphone, we can change it, of course. But I really like the the idea of the check boxes.

74
00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:02.960
Iso Rabins: Yes.

75
00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:03.920
Vasilii: Team officers.

76
00:16:04.190 --> 00:16:08.071
Vasilii: We we just like need to make it more like, you know,

77
00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:14.020
Vasilii: more obvious that you can click on it. It's the main problem with the check boxes.

78
00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:42.536
Vasilii: So and so, for example, maybe we can add some text here, for example, like, even like click on the check boxes, maybe in some playful way to with, maybe with some font or something. But yeah, the idea actually, really good. I think we can stick on this idea and trying to make it more interesting. But the idea is really good. I really like it. So yeah.

79
00:16:43.650 --> 00:16:50.229
Iso Rabins: Awesome man. Yeah, these are cool. I like, I like the direction something something I was thinking about like. So

80
00:16:50.430 --> 00:17:11.609
Iso Rabins: the kind of tension between our 2 approaches in some ways has been not in a negative, but has been that like, I want this kind of homemade vibe, and your and your idea looks way more like an actual tech product. Right? Like you. Look at your, you look at your ideas, and it's like, Oh, this is like a tech product that I'm gonna subscribe to. And my idea is.

81
00:17:11.619 --> 00:17:12.039
Vasilii: Like well.

82
00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:14.533
Iso Rabins: I'm not really sure what this is.

83
00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:26.573
Iso Rabins: and I think I think something. So I I think some something I was thinking about, that, I think, is also important, and is a little uncommon. Maybe.

84
00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:28.280
Vasilii: Like.

85
00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:47.489
Iso Rabins: In some ways, especially in the beginning, like this is not like a mass market tech product, right like, especially in the beginning, people are going to find out about it word of mouth, probably through my email list, through my social media. And actually, what I want them to feel on some level is that this is something that they're

86
00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:56.960
Iso Rabins: they're like finding themselves, that they're a part of like, I don't think a lot of people are gonna be like googling around, especially in the beginning.

87
00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:03.459
Iso Rabins: and like finding us randomly right? So it's almost it's almost like

88
00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:09.960
Iso Rabins: I want it to look less professional. Does that make sense like.

89
00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:11.710
Vasilii: Okay, I got you guys. See here.

90
00:18:11.710 --> 00:18:19.829
Iso Rabins: Like like we kind of like want it to not look too perfect, because especially because it won't be perfect in the beginning.

91
00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:27.759
Iso Rabins: That if it looks too much like a perfect mass market tech product.

92
00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:35.930
Iso Rabins: kind of like the expectation. And the feeling is like, there's a little bit less personality there, right like you don't know

93
00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:42.820
Iso Rabins: like you look at even the bread. The breakfast, actually like has an interesting balance on some ways, because you kind of like feel like

94
00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:50.851
Iso Rabins: like they're they're kind of branding. And their copy kind of feels like, Oh, like we're in this together a little bit. But like it's still really, really clean.

95
00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:53.989
Iso Rabins: But I almost feel like we want to go

96
00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:57.499
Iso Rabins: even. And this could change over time, right? But like

97
00:18:58.570 --> 00:19:01.970
Iso Rabins: website that, we kind of want to go in this direction of like.

98
00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:09.080
Iso Rabins: Hey, look! Look at this cool thing you discovered. That's kind of just starting out.

99
00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:10.420
Iso Rabins: What do you.

100
00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:11.150
Vasilii: Yeah, yeah.

101
00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:12.180
Iso Rabins: What do you think of that idea.

102
00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:20.690
Vasilii: Absolutely, absolutely. We. Actually, we're trying to reach this idea on. As as I said to you, it's the

103
00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:45.530
Vasilii: that's what the breakfast wipe have like. They are too confident in themselves that they can afford, just like one landing page site with the small description and only one photo shoot of the iphone. And that's it. It's almost like when the designer said to you, I'm actually not that interesting in your opinion, but I'm really respect.

104
00:19:45.700 --> 00:20:13.740
Vasilii: and I'm making something tasteful for you. I think that's the what you're talking about. It's not if we're talking about the touch product, their sites, their site looking not like professional professional. There's not too many like animations, not too many. Like as as we were talking as we were seeing a lot of landing page right now. They have all these ux like type of effects, you know, they don't have it at all, because, like.

105
00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:42.840
Vasilii: it's really like super super simple. And some of the Ux developer Ui developer will say, Okay, it's not that professional. But we with you understand that this is this is actually really professional that's looking so simple that many people will say, like, Oh, really, it's interesting, but it's unique at the same time. And I think we're right now. We're chasing this idea to make something unique.

106
00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:59.979
Vasilii: not that professional, but at the same time like interesting to, not to not afraid people to show them that we are actually like knowing what we're doing. So it's like, kind of this balance between be professional.

107
00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:23.889
Vasilii: But on such level, when you can put something really simple, unique. And people will say to you, Okay, it's not that like, okay, it's not super like professional. Maybe it's not ready yet. But okay, I trust it on the level, because I see, okay, like, it's stylish. It's looking interesting. And something like this. So it's it's kind of like this type of balance between it. You know what I mean

108
00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:41.410
Vasilii: like to to make something yeah, like simple and like, on such level, there is like a lot of professionals still in here, but like professionalism here, it's not about like we're not putting here like. I mean, some

109
00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:59.540
Vasilii: like plugins into the, you know, like this waterfalls like binary code or something to show everyone that we can make really nice landing pages. Now, we just like have to put something here, really simple. Maybe

110
00:21:59.770 --> 00:22:01.660
Vasilii: because, like, for example.

111
00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:29.580
Vasilii: put Paul here in such way, it's not that professional, but still we have to make it stylish to looking like we're no that it was the idea we could make anything for you. We could make really nice landing, but we actually prefer to make it so simple to you to not making to make you warm. Vibe. You know what I mean. Something like this is, gonna be our message here. I think

112
00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:42.089
Vasilii: so. And I I think something like this. It's not like professional at all. Or, for example, like this one is just like, it's interesting. It's kind of unique. It's like

113
00:22:42.410 --> 00:22:50.719
Vasilii: engaging, too, but like people when when they will see it, they will see that we are actually knowing how to use phones

114
00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:52.965
Vasilii: how to use.

115
00:22:53.720 --> 00:23:20.240
Vasilii: we have logo type. Here we have interesting, like design approach. Here we have all actually necessary buttons like join. Wait, list, learn more. Something like this little bit like ui interface with this clicking buttons or something. So it's not that super like professional professional, but they will understand that we are actually knowing what we are doing that we can make the landing page for our product.

116
00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:26.029
Vasilii: You know what I mean. It's like, it's boosted our trusted resources. Even if the people will.

117
00:23:27.925 --> 00:23:37.029
Vasilii: get into application through, for example, your social media, or something. I think it's still like a little bit necessary to make it

118
00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:41.110
Vasilii: to show people that we are not.

119
00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:51.459
Vasilii: that we actually like thinking about the people and thinking about their taste and everything, and showing our best parts of us, you know, but it means something like this.

120
00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:56.960
Vasilii: because it's it's still. It's still like a face of the application. It's still like face.

121
00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:57.320
Iso Rabins: So.

122
00:23:57.320 --> 00:24:03.599
Vasilii: Application. And it's like, you know, for example, for example, you can

123
00:24:04.798 --> 00:24:09.410
Vasilii: already, I think, you can

124
00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:23.320
Vasilii: go and show that your product to the people, because so they already will use it on such level. I mean, just like, Hey, I bought in the slack and everything. But you're still want to develop it in a better way.

125
00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:34.899
Vasilii: This is a kind of like professionalism. We are talking about the same stuff in the design. So you can right. Now go and go in the public and show it to some people and start

126
00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:55.779
Vasilii: the project. But you still want to make some tweaks, some changes, to make it better to people, even if they don't understand what they're doing. But you're still doing as a program is as a developer, because you know that there should be more like professional insight. The same stuff. We're talking about right now into design, but it's like my part of the job.

127
00:24:55.970 --> 00:25:01.040
Vasilii: so so yeah, yes,

128
00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:06.399
Iso Rabins: Yeah, totally. Yeah, like, what do you think about? Like, almost think about it, like.

129
00:25:06.810 --> 00:25:09.389
Iso Rabins: because there's something about when people feel like

130
00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:20.559
Iso Rabins: they're supporting something that's exciting, that the people who are making it are excited about almost like almost like the motivation of

131
00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:22.539
Iso Rabins: giving to a Kickstarter

132
00:25:22.910 --> 00:25:29.510
Iso Rabins: right like there's this feeling like, oh, this is this cool thing that I so say, like you gave to a Kickstarter for like a book, you know, you're like, Oh.

133
00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:29.880
Iso Rabins: this is

134
00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:37.080
Iso Rabins: book I really want to read, but like, when you get the book, you feel so much more excited because you feel like you are one of the people who made the book.

135
00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:39.099
Iso Rabins: you know, and there's something.

136
00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:56.209
Iso Rabins: There's something there's like some. And that's how I've kind of approached. So I've never made a tech product. But that's definitely how I've approached my projects in the past, and like like I raised like 150 k on Kickstarter for one of my projects so like

137
00:25:56.470 --> 00:26:03.740
Iso Rabins: this kind of like, Hey, let's bring the community together behind this thing like I've had a lot of success with.

138
00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:07.570
Iso Rabins: and I'm wondering how to

139
00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:15.207
Iso Rabins: bridge that with this. And again, like this is something that could change in the future right?

140
00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:22.380
Iso Rabins: like. It doesn't exactly have to have this vibe forever. But like, do you understand? Does that make sense like.

141
00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:23.250
Vasilii: Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely

142
00:26:23.250 --> 00:26:28.320
Vasilii: like, it's almost like, like you, almost like, I think that you were speaking to this, too. But you almost want it to like.

143
00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:32.069
Iso Rabins: Look not done somehow.

144
00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:33.470
Vasilii: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

145
00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:36.850
Iso Rabins: Because it makes people feel like they're there in the beginning, like they're an early adopter.

146
00:26:36.850 --> 00:26:37.360
Vasilii: Absolutely.

147
00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:38.100
Iso Rabins: Minutes.

148
00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:50.990
Vasilii: That's actually that's that's the how our landing page right now, looking like absolutely like we don't have anything. We only have this like block. And here's the only like text

149
00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:53.949
Vasilii: and frequency asked questions. And it's.

150
00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:54.460
Iso Rabins: Yeah, yeah.

151
00:26:54.460 --> 00:27:03.319
Vasilii: Just like it's super not done landing page. But that's that's the how I really like it. How this looks like it's just like

152
00:27:03.670 --> 00:27:21.339
Vasilii: only necessary thing that people should know and about the Kickstarter and all the things stuff. And that's why I think it's really important to use such platforms as a product hunt, because there is a lot of people who is actually supporting the product

153
00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:45.689
Vasilii: who is want to be in community. And it's all depends. For example, we will make maybe some little pitch deck about the this like software, creative minds, everything. This projects target on such people to creative people. And then maybe we will find some suffered and help from them who like 1st users, who will go and try because

154
00:27:45.690 --> 00:27:54.489
Vasilii: there's a lot of actually a community of people who really like to try the new products and who really like to support

155
00:27:54.862 --> 00:28:03.799
Vasilii: developers with the new products and everything and product hunt. It's the platform for where these people is actually hanging out all the time.

156
00:28:03.970 --> 00:28:05.420
Vasilii: So

157
00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:28.119
Vasilii: I mean, it's almost like a Kickstarter. But Kickstarter, as I understand right now stopped working. I mean, just like it's not giving such like results like it was before. So yeah, right now, the product hunt the same crunch base. But crunch base is more about like investors. It's not about the mind people. So product hunts is like the best option for us.

158
00:28:28.592 --> 00:28:54.370
Vasilii: Yeah. But still, as I showed you on the product, there's a lot of products who is more like professionals. But okay, we yeah, we are not looking for professionals here with, we are actually more interested in the idea. What we put inside of the product more than just like, was the money and everything. And I think we can play with. This, too, is a good marketing strategy to saying like, Oh, absolutely free. Just go and

159
00:28:54.370 --> 00:29:03.450
Vasilii: try. Just be really interesting in your feedback. Here's our site and everything like this. So, but it's more like about marketing.

160
00:29:04.210 --> 00:29:27.051
Vasilii: And here is still, it's like more about like face, and how we approach people. And I think if we're making something as you with this check boxes and we make it interesting, it's more like a playful way it's really easy. It's not that common. And I think it's interesting. And for example, when when you know, when you start

161
00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:45.293
Vasilii: that's why, for example, here, remember, I really wanted to put some welcome words, and I think it's really interesting when you click on all check boxes, and you got the 1st words like welcome to Fridays at 4. And it's really, really super. It's

162
00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:56.049
Vasilii: uncommon thing right now, when someone's actually welcome you to the application of something. It's like more like welcome to the family. Welcome to Fridays at 4,

163
00:29:56.080 --> 00:30:22.000
Vasilii: and I think with such details we will give this like a warm and not professional wipe, because we will approach our people a different way than all the developers, because they approach like, go, buy, go, click, go, subscribe, go free trial. We don't have anything like this. We have just like welcome welcome. And that's it. And I think it's really interesting. It's kind of unique to.

164
00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:28.569
Iso Rabins: Yeah. Can you? A couple of things one can you share the link to this again to your figma again.

165
00:30:28.570 --> 00:30:30.509
Vasilii: Yeah, yeah, of course, of course.

166
00:30:30.510 --> 00:30:35.190
Iso Rabins: And I wanted to ask. I wanted to ask you, like, what have you seen on product? Kind of as far as like

167
00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:43.300
Iso Rabins: like launching and charging like like. What? What have you seen? Work

168
00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:48.560
Iso Rabins: as far as like launching a like launching application?

169
00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:51.539
Iso Rabins: How how long do you

170
00:30:51.830 --> 00:31:10.800
Iso Rabins: have beta testers that you don't charge like, when do you start charging that kind of stuff? Because, actually, like with this product is interesting because I'm gonna be paying for the Api call. And like, I probably actually don't want to pay for it for that long because it's actually it will actually be expensive to run this product.

171
00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:32.150
Vasilii: It's yeah, yeah, it's it's like, it's all depends on your budget. Actually, because still, we are working right now, only with like Chatgpc and so and model. Yes, and we didn't have any like optimization of the budget. So we actually don't know how much users will go into it. We still don't know how much they will use it. The chatgpt still like kind of

172
00:31:32.150 --> 00:31:49.400
Vasilii: it's not that expensive, but it's all depends, as you know, on the request and everything. So if we got like 100 users, maybe we'll spend like, I don't know. Actually we will. We don't have this calculation right now. How much actually it cost to use our AI.

173
00:31:49.410 --> 00:31:50.590
Vasilii: But

174
00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:58.640
Vasilii: we don't have this calculation yet. And so, but but actually for me, how it's working, for example, when when

175
00:31:59.441 --> 00:32:05.269
Vasilii: some people you know this trying to think about like a service, for example, a lot of people when this

176
00:32:05.270 --> 00:32:29.660
Vasilii: start doing their product, they go to Amazon, they buying the really expensive server because they really think that there's going to be like thousands and thousands of people who will use this product, and they need to like really nice security and everything. But in my opinion, it's a more interesting strategy. When you actually buy, for example, cheap server, and if your server cannot.

177
00:32:29.660 --> 00:32:30.640
Vasilii: you know.

178
00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:45.409
Vasilii: handle like 1,000 users who came up in like 1st week, then you move to the more expensive server only in this way, you know, just like for example, in here for we will launch the product.

179
00:32:46.151 --> 00:33:05.049
Vasilii: We will try to promote it. We will see how many people will go to it, how many people will test it out, how much maybe users we got who start using like on a daily basis. And then we will understand. Okay, they are spending our money. Our budget is right now, like, for example, like

180
00:33:05.530 --> 00:33:26.399
Vasilii: for the month, we can handle this users. Okay, now, let's think about how to how to. Maybe made some paid versions because the users already using daily basis, they understand the functionality they get used to, they need it in their work routine. And so, okay, now, we can, for example.

181
00:33:26.610 --> 00:33:28.160
Vasilii: afford to

182
00:33:29.087 --> 00:33:53.729
Vasilii: offer them the paid subscription. Okay. But if, for example, there are gonna be not too much users, and we will understand. Okay, we have this budget. And it's we can continue the free mode. So why not? So? I think it's not that necessary right now to think about it, but it's all about like how much people will get on the beginning, and that's it, and how much users will get.

183
00:33:54.420 --> 00:34:15.730
Vasilii: So I think it's it's always like worth it to maybe spend a little bit more in the beginning. If there is gonna be high demand and if we understand, okay, we have 100 users who will pay for a thousand users who will for the free trial. That's gonna work. So and that's how it's going on

184
00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:17.570
Vasilii: all the time. So.

185
00:34:17.570 --> 00:34:18.550
Iso Rabins: Hmm, yeah, just.

186
00:34:18.550 --> 00:34:28.029
Vasilii: Yeah, because it's because, yeah, because it's still like, we're not like making, you know, super like professional model. We're not thinking.

187
00:34:28.250 --> 00:34:56.560
Vasilii: it's like, we're not doing something super commercial. So if you're doing something super commercial, if you already have, like a lot of users, if you have a lot of background with like investors and everything. And you're really preparing for the launch product. I mean, just like, there, you can make some predictive thing and predict how much users you got on the 1st day. Okay, how much you will spend on the budget for the free trial and everything.

188
00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:58.908
Vasilii: But here is still like more

189
00:34:59.450 --> 00:35:26.670
Vasilii: we have more like creative product here. So and we are actually not focused on the commercial thing. Because if you will focus on the commercials we will use, you know, my 1st landing page where the slack, a product manager and everything. And we can maybe analyze the market. And we can make the database of the users who will actually like use it on the Linkedin, or something like the marketing company with

190
00:35:26.670 --> 00:35:48.920
Vasilii: the email advertising or something or Linkedin advertising. So for example, if we got like a database of the product managers like for like 100,000 people, we will understand. Okay, maybe 5%. We will use it. Okay, it's 1,000 people. We have a budget for 2,000. So okay, they can use it for like a week. Then we have to.

191
00:35:48.920 --> 00:36:12.800
Vasilii: So you know, like, I mean, it's like one big strategy here. Still, if we are still not focusing like to make it really like commercial, commercial. Okay, we're not thinking about it. So I think we have to just like launch, see the results. And then like, think about it. And and speaking with the community, even maybe it will boost your trust resource. Like some people some businessmen are doing. For example.

192
00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:14.170
Vasilii: they put

193
00:36:15.066 --> 00:36:32.910
Vasilii: the free version. Then they ask people, okay, now, we need the money. Here is like a link. You can donate us. And, for example, if you see there is some donations or something then they can. Just like, go on this like

194
00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:57.630
Vasilii: kind of like paid versions from just like people who actually care about your product who respect your product will pay to you, and there's gonna be enough money, or you can even ask your people like, Excuse me, but we have to move to the paid subscription version, because blah blah blah, you know, and they will understand you. It's more like boost your trust level to your people because you actually like acting more like a community here.

195
00:36:57.810 --> 00:37:05.220
Vasilii: you actually care about your people. So you're asking them what kind of price you want to see, or something like this.

196
00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:14.080
Vasilii: So yeah, there's like a lot of actually options, how you can communicate with your community and how you can solve this problem and just like money problem to the project.

197
00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:19.360
Iso Rabins: Yeah, yeah, yeah, no. It's a good way to think about it. Yeah, I think 1st step is.

198
00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:27.000
Iso Rabins: get it out there. It's close. Actually. So I've been working on getting the getting the slack.

199
00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:33.500
Iso Rabins: getting slack to work with multiple workspaces. And I think once.

200
00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:33.920
Vasilii: Again.

201
00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:38.069
Iso Rabins: Like, you know, there's like always like tweaks to do. But I definitely don't wanna

202
00:37:38.490 --> 00:37:40.519
Iso Rabins: wait too long, like try to get.

203
00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:51.710
Vasilii: Yeah, yeah, right now, actually, the product is almost like a complete Mvp, it's already good. Mvp, so you can show it to the people, 100% to test out your life theories.

204
00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:58.124
Iso Rabins: Yeah, I think it works pretty well. Yeah. So I'm I'm just getting it. I'm gonna get live. So people can install it. And then

205
00:38:00.050 --> 00:38:01.650
Iso Rabins: kind of go from there.

206
00:38:03.070 --> 00:38:04.770
Vasilii: Absolutely, absolutely

207
00:38:05.350 --> 00:38:26.509
Vasilii: so actually, even like the lending with, I think with your idea, with the checks boxes, is something that we try to find something in the middle between, like a web app application and like community thing when you're like, right away, start speaking with your audience. I think it's kind of interesting

208
00:38:26.550 --> 00:38:37.620
Vasilii: ways, kind of interesting approach to your community when you just like, right away, start asking some questions that they answer to you. So it's interesting.

209
00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:58.259
Vasilii: And I think we can stick on this solution. And just like, for example, maybe I will to the next meeting that I didn't. Do find some interesting, more like warm picture that you want to. Maybe these pictures give us the vibe like kind of unprofessional vibe to it.

210
00:38:58.370 --> 00:39:03.070
Vasilii: And I think we're like done almost here. So.

211
00:39:04.820 --> 00:39:11.820
Iso Rabins: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let me look at it and play with it. Here, I'll and put your

212
00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:19.170
Iso Rabins: your things. Don't set up what happened to my word.

213
00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:27.967
Iso Rabins: Cool man, awesome thanks for working on that stuff

214
00:39:28.450 --> 00:39:33.090
Vasilii: This is my pleasure. It's really I'm really enjoying this project.

215
00:39:33.090 --> 00:39:46.069
Iso Rabins: Oh, yeah, good man, I'm glad. Yeah, no, I'm enjoying working with you. Yeah, what do you? I mean? What do you think like from. So from your kind of tech from your background, working a lot of tech projects like, do you think this is fucking? You think it's gonna work? Do you think like.

216
00:39:46.415 --> 00:39:47.449
Vasilii: Just like straight.

217
00:39:47.450 --> 00:40:03.779
Iso Rabins: Like like I, you know, it's like I can probably get some people to sign up. But like, I'm not really sure it's cause it's a very different kind of product, right? It's not like, you know, the easiest thing would be to make like some product manager, like really simple product project manager.

218
00:40:04.030 --> 00:40:12.380
Iso Rabins: But this is like, you know, it's a little bit harder to explain to people. It's like a little bit oh, I think you shared the dev mode

219
00:40:12.830 --> 00:40:13.809
Iso Rabins: with me.

220
00:40:13.810 --> 00:40:19.880
Vasilii: Oh, I I show you not that mode. One second. Excuse me, my bad, my bad, my bad.

221
00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:21.589
Iso Rabins: Maybe I can get back to the.

222
00:40:22.580 --> 00:40:25.820
Vasilii: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me. Excuse me.

223
00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:35.034
Vasilii: yeah. Actually, like as I said, like, you've seen my approach as like a product manager when I'm starting

224
00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:40.530
Vasilii: working on some new products. I always like trying to make something super commercial.

225
00:40:40.660 --> 00:41:05.049
Vasilii: and that's in my head. If we're talking about like work or not work actually like, it's really like common question. And so it's more like to be or not to be, you know no one have the answer for this question, because, like totally, no, no product managers at this world know exactly that the product will pop up or no. There's like always like.

226
00:41:05.050 --> 00:41:11.230
Vasilii: even if they know on the 90%, there is still 10% when it's not gonna work at all.

227
00:41:11.230 --> 00:41:26.160
Vasilii: So I cannot say to you only one thing that you can do. It's like boosting the chances for me. This project is really like actually really useful product for a lot of a lot of people.

228
00:41:26.190 --> 00:41:30.636
Vasilii: But if, if, as I said, if we start

229
00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:37.540
Vasilii: thinking about how to boost the chances for this product, of course, it's more like it's gonna be more.

230
00:41:37.850 --> 00:42:05.640
Vasilii: I think. How I can say potential to target the like managers. And everyone like this, not that creative people you're trying to find and to make the landing page with the slack making more like focus on the AI in the slack and chat bots, making more focus, not on the creativity, but on the work, I think, is like boosted it will.

231
00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:08.879
Vasilii: How I can say

232
00:42:09.020 --> 00:42:23.419
Vasilii: it will do more like actually working people who is not that creative will find useful. This will find this application useful. But since we are our target audiences like creative people.

233
00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:44.139
Vasilii: it's interesting. And I'm really interested. And I'm really curious to test it out. But who knows? Who knows? Actually, I cannot say to you is gonna work or not, product is really good. Idea is really good. This slack environment is really good everything like potential here, a lot of potential.

234
00:42:44.140 --> 00:43:10.680
Vasilii: So let's, for example, test your theory, and we have, like 2 theories to make it more like by becoming unity creative people. It's 1 theory. And second, it was my previous. My 1st actually theory is more focused on the AI, more focused on the slack and more focused on the working people in the business niche. So if the 1st theory is not going to work out, maybe we will try the second one.

235
00:43:10.690 --> 00:43:11.590
Vasilii: For example, the.

236
00:43:12.515 --> 00:43:20.339
Iso Rabins: let let's test it out. We like, we have a time. So and we are still actually, you know it's always like.

237
00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:39.180
Vasilii: Since we are not like a big company we don't have, or like influencers, or like we don't have like marketing. You know office who say to us, Okay, your target audience, this, this we still like, have more like hypothesis here. So

238
00:43:39.180 --> 00:43:57.970
Vasilii: let's test it out. Let's see how it's gonna work, and then we will make a tweaks like in landings. And the design in like, in marketing. Maybe strategy make it maybe more narrow like we always can change it up to find the people who is actually interesting in our project.

239
00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:21.150
Vasilii: So yeah, but it's I really like the project. It's really like, simple idea, really good idea for Mvp. And I was telling you, this is like beginning. Since we start working. This was really smart to pick up the slack environment, not making your own web application or something. So I mean, there's like a lot of potential a lot of.

240
00:44:21.150 --> 00:44:21.470
Iso Rabins: What's it?

241
00:44:21.470 --> 00:44:24.859
Vasilii: And so let's see how it's gonna work.

242
00:44:25.350 --> 00:44:25.730
Iso Rabins: Yeah.

243
00:44:25.730 --> 00:44:26.190
Vasilii: So, yeah.

244
00:44:26.190 --> 00:44:38.562
Iso Rabins: Cool. Thanks. Yeah, yeah, it's interesting with products like this, right? Because a lot of my stuff has been in person. So it's like, you know, you launch an event, and you need people to show up. They're either gonna show up or they're not gonna show up right like.

245
00:44:38.810 --> 00:44:40.179
Vasilii: Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, yeah.

246
00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:49.479
Iso Rabins: What's cool about this is like, you can A B test 2 different websites and just see what people sign up more. Right? So there can be one this morning.

247
00:44:49.480 --> 00:44:50.250
Iso Rabins: Yes, absolutely

248
00:44:50.250 --> 00:44:57.659
Iso Rabins: one. That's more product manager. And they're the products, the same. They're just coming in these 2 funnels. You can continually be changing it. There's unlimited

249
00:44:58.190 --> 00:45:05.412
Iso Rabins: in the world who could theoretically sign up to this thing right? Like it's not like we have like one chance. And then we're like we're out right.

250
00:45:05.670 --> 00:45:06.630
Vasilii: Absolutely.

251
00:45:06.630 --> 00:45:07.019
Iso Rabins: That's an.

252
00:45:07.020 --> 00:45:28.199
Vasilii: So actually, it's it's always like, how actually like startups doing if we're like using the lean startups theory. So we just like make some changes or we make some product. Then we go to the feedback. We get this feedback. And we make the changes to the people. Actually. So that's how it's always about the Ab

253
00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:52.909
Vasilii: testing. It's always like this. And it's always based. It should be based on the people's feedback because we are making the product for people, not for ourselves. And it's really like, sometimes it's painful when you understand that people will actually need only one. For example, function from all your application and all other functions they don't need at all. But he was like thinking about it. It was like

254
00:45:52.910 --> 00:46:10.629
Vasilii: thinking, that's the killer feature. And then you realize more people don't need it at all. They just like need only one function. And I knew like a lot of startups. Actually, they have like big, big, big, big conception. And there was only one feature, for example, like, you know, like small calls.

255
00:46:10.710 --> 00:46:20.489
Vasilii: And then these small calls, like, you know, like, turns out into like big, big tech products like discord or something.

256
00:46:20.490 --> 00:46:22.360
Iso Rabins: Yeah, we're slack, slack.

257
00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:23.620
Vasilii: Or slack. Yeah, yeah.

258
00:46:23.620 --> 00:46:27.309
Iso Rabins: Like an internal like product. They made right? Yeah.

259
00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:30.944
Vasilii: So, yeah, so for example, you just like,

260
00:46:31.610 --> 00:46:35.859
Iso Rabins: You know what I just heard, too. Another funny story like that is flickr

261
00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:56.119
Iso Rabins: was originally. It was this couple, like a man and a woman in Canada. And they were trying to build like this big multiplayer, online game and like it wasn't working, it wasn't working. They couldn't get anything to work, and the only thing they got working was like the upload of the Avatar. The pictures people could upload their pictures for Avatar.

262
00:46:57.280 --> 00:46:58.829
Iso Rabins: That became Flickr.

263
00:46:59.570 --> 00:47:00.999
Vasilii: Yes, absolutely. Absolutely.

264
00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:02.099
Iso Rabins: You know, it's like so.

265
00:47:02.100 --> 00:47:27.759
Vasilii: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 10% of the whole application, like a side feature became the whole product. That's how. But for to actually get to this point. You just like you need to get as much feedback as you have to like as you can. That's the main point. And you actually have to listen to this feedback and understand how to work with this feedback of the people. That's the crucial part when you're making any startup.

266
00:47:28.280 --> 00:47:52.830
Vasilii: and especially if you're making like something innovative. And if you're not like a big, big, big company, and you're making the new product. Of course, if you're making, for example, like new version of already existing product, it's absolutely different strategy. But still, like, there's a lot of examples. When people already have a big product, they trying to make some tweaks. They think that it's gonna be useful

267
00:47:52.830 --> 00:48:06.819
Vasilii: or something. But it's like total disaster, like it was with the Youtube, like Facebook like with a lot of application, who was actually in the beginning more convenient, more interesting, more potential than they are right now.

268
00:48:06.820 --> 00:48:15.289
Vasilii: because the people like stopped to actually hearing the feedback from their users, and they just like

269
00:48:15.570 --> 00:48:22.662
Vasilii: start making tweaks for themselves. That's always like the big big problem of the big tech company.

270
00:48:23.908 --> 00:48:50.720
Vasilii: But yeah, since here we are on the beginning, it's more exciting part here, so we will see. We'll see. And we have to just like, get as much feedback as we can work with it and understand what? Actually, people are interesting. Yeah. And right now, we just like the main point here trying to find our target audience. Understand, is this creative people? Or is it? That's people that you're hate from the managers.

271
00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:55.790
Vasilii: managers in b 2 b companies. So but why not? You know, it's still like.

272
00:48:56.764 --> 00:49:09.795
Vasilii: We're still making product for people. If these people are sitting and looking, not as people that we are get used to. So but okay, if they're gonna appreciate this product, why not? Let's work with them. So

273
00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:15.379
Vasilii: so it's it's gonna work like this? So, yeah, yeah.

274
00:49:15.380 --> 00:49:18.150
Iso Rabins: I just feel like so many people are. You know, it's like

275
00:49:18.330 --> 00:49:22.070
Iso Rabins: so many people target those managers right? Like

276
00:49:22.550 --> 00:49:44.150
Iso Rabins: that's like the target of every product is the kind of like b 2 b managers. So I feel like this, we target a different, different demographic. And also I don't know if I've said this to you. But like my kind of vision is that with AI, a lot of people in like kind of creative class jobs are gonna lose their jobs. Candidly, you know, or they're they're gonna have a lot less work.

277
00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:48.410
Iso Rabins: And so they're all going to be looking to do their own projects. And this is like.

278
00:49:48.860 --> 00:49:56.410
Iso Rabins: this is what helps them do it like. This is the product that actually helps them do it. So that's kind of my! That's my feeling, too, and my approach with the kind of.

279
00:49:56.410 --> 00:50:02.990
Vasilii: You know, to target yeah, target to the people who lost their job with AI to offer them new, a product

280
00:50:02.990 --> 00:50:07.709
Vasilii: to use? AI, yeah, to play with this robotic experience here.

281
00:50:07.710 --> 00:50:09.739
Iso Rabins: Yeah. But what's beautiful is like.

282
00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:10.260
Vasilii: Yeah.

283
00:50:10.260 --> 00:50:17.529
Iso Rabins: Know, it's using AI in a productive way, in a positive way. So it's like, maybe they had this experience with like losing their job because of AI.

284
00:50:17.530 --> 00:50:19.140
Vasilii: Change their mind, change their mind.

285
00:50:19.140 --> 00:50:21.590
Iso Rabins: Their mind. Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

286
00:50:21.590 --> 00:50:41.060
Vasilii: Maybe. Maybe. Yeah, yeah, no, it's yeah. Yeah. We'll see. We'll see definitely. Definitely. Okay. So let's sketch up schedule the meeting on the slack, I think, but like the Friday is gonna be like tricky day, I think for me the next one. Maybe the Tuesday is gonna be better so. But we can figure it out in the weekend.

287
00:50:41.120 --> 00:51:03.930
Vasilii: like we usually do. So I'm really, I'm really sorry for my delay today. And yeah, let's a little bit structurize our work together. And yeah, and for me, right now, I'm still like, really want to think about like this images we're talking about to make it maybe known more. Not this professional, maybe something really like sketchy drawing.

288
00:51:04.150 --> 00:51:19.500
Vasilii: or maybe something like sketchy, but stylish. So I'll think about it. And maybe. Yeah, think about my this type of design. And like, as always, I looking for your feedback, maybe for your tweaks, and we will move.

289
00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:21.090
Vasilii: Move on.

290
00:51:21.620 --> 00:51:29.450
Iso Rabins: Cool. That's good. Yeah. I'll try to work on it on Tuesday. I'll spend some time. I'm kind of playing around. Yeah. Well, why don't we just say, if Thursday at 5 works.

291
00:51:29.860 --> 00:51:35.500
Iso Rabins: let's just schedule that we can tentatively, and if something comes up we can change it. But rather than just going back and forth.

292
00:51:35.500 --> 00:51:36.430
Vasilii: Okay, how's it?

293
00:51:37.570 --> 00:51:38.670
Vasilii: Or that'd be 30.

294
00:51:38.670 --> 00:51:39.319
Vasilii: She is.

295
00:51:39.320 --> 00:51:41.869
Iso Rabins: 11, or whatever whatever time.

296
00:51:41.870 --> 00:51:42.230
Vasilii: One sec.

297
00:51:42.230 --> 00:51:42.740
Iso Rabins: For you today.

298
00:51:42.740 --> 00:51:46.949
Vasilii: Yes, second of January. Yes.

299
00:51:46.950 --> 00:51:47.650
Iso Rabins: Executive.

300
00:51:48.063 --> 00:51:54.679
Vasilii: Thursday. And what's the time? 5 5 Pm. Is is gonna work. Yeah, I think so.

301
00:51:54.680 --> 00:52:00.470
Iso Rabins: That's that's for me. So just whatever time it started today. So 5 Pm. Vietnam.

302
00:52:00.470 --> 00:52:04.130
Vasilii: 5. 5. Okay, okay. 11. That's great. That's great.

303
00:52:04.130 --> 00:52:04.500
Iso Rabins: Hello!

304
00:52:04.500 --> 00:52:13.770
Vasilii: I will. I will make the right now to one second. One second 11.

305
00:52:15.690 --> 00:52:16.350
Vasilii: Think

306
00:52:20.150 --> 00:52:23.040
Vasilii: I'll see seconds.

307
00:52:25.950 --> 00:52:31.460
Vasilii: Yep, I'll send you invitation. So, okay, cool.

Vasilii: I'm looking for your tweaks and your ideas to work with, too.
