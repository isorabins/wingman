# 🎯 Project Brief: Fridays at Four

## 🚀 Project Mission
Build an AI-powered creative project management platform that helps users plan, execute, and complete their creative projects through **three-dimensional AI personalization**: personality archetypes, collective learning insights, and natural relationship evolution.

## 🎨 Core Requirements

### 🔥 Primary Goals
1. **Viral Personality-Driven Onboarding** - Replace traditional signup with engaging 15-question creativity test
2. **Three-Dimensional AI Coach** - Hai adapts to user's archetype, learns from all interactions, and evolves over time
3. **Global Learning Memory** - AI gets smarter from every user interaction, sharing insights across platform
4. **Natural Relationship Evolution** - Foundation → Rhythm → Skills → Mastery progression over months
5. **Authentic Creative Support** - Help users complete meaningful projects through personalized, evolving guidance

### 🎪 Strategic Differentiation
- **Viral Acquisition**: Personality test drives organic user growth through social sharing
- **Multi-Dimensional Personalization**: Impossible-to-replicate AI that adapts on 3 dimensions simultaneously
- **Relationship Investment**: Users develop long-term connection as Hai evolves with them
- **Data Network Effects**: Platform gets better for everyone as more users join

### 👥 Target Users
- **Creative professionals** aged 25-45 working on personal projects (writing, music, art, content)
- **Entrepreneurs** building businesses, side projects, or creative ventures
- **Liberal arts backgrounds** who are tech-savvy but seeking authentic creative support
- **Anyone** with meaningful creative projects who wants personality-matched AI coaching

### 🎯 Success Metrics
- **Viral Growth**: >25% of personality test takers share results socially
- **Onboarding**: >90% completion rate for personality-driven onboarding
- **Retention**: Users progressing through evolution stages (Foundation → Mastery)
- **AI Learning**: Insights database improving user experience measurably
- **Relationship Depth**: Users reporting stronger connection to Hai over time

## 🔧 Technical Constraints

### 🏗️ Architecture (Updated)
- **Backend**: Python FastAPI + Direct Claude API + Supabase PostgreSQL
- **AI Strategy**: Three-dimensional personalization with real-time context assembly
- **Frontend**: Separate React/Next.js application (different repository)
- **Deployment**: Heroku for backend, frontend deployed separately
- **Database**: Supabase hosted PostgreSQL with personality, insights, and evolution tracking

### 🔗 Integration Points
- Backend API: `fridays-at-four-c9c6b7a513be.herokuapp.com`
- Frontend: `app.fridaysatfour.co`
- Database: `ipvxxsthulsysbkwbitu.supabase.co`
- **NEW**: Personality test interface and social sharing endpoints
- **NEW**: Global insights system for cross-user AI learning

### ⚡ Non-Negotiables
- Must work in production environment with <1 second response times
- Three-dimensional personalization must be reliable and graceful
- Personality test must be engaging and shareable on all platforms
- AI must not make false promises (especially about scheduling calls)
- User conversations must persist with full archetype and evolution context
- Global insights must never leak personal information between users

## 🎪 Project Scope

### ✅ In Scope
- **Viral Personality Test**: 15-question quiz with 6 archetypes and social sharing
- **Three-Dimensional AI**: Personality + global insights + evolution stage integration
- **Global Learning System**: AI insights database with cross-user intelligence
- **Evolution Stages**: Foundation → Rhythm → Skills → Mastery progression
- **Enhanced Memory**: Multi-dimensional context management and retrieval
- **Archetype-Aware Features**: Temperature mapping, prompt customization, progress celebration

### 🚫 Out of Scope (for now)
- Video call scheduling automation
- File uploads and document management
- Team collaboration features
- Mobile applications (beyond responsive web)
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- Partner matching system (Phase 3+)

## 🌟 Quality Standards
- **Performance**: <1 second response times with three-dimensional context assembly
- **Reliability**: 99%+ uptime with graceful degradation for personalization failures
- **Test Coverage**: 100% coverage for critical paths including all personalization dimensions
- **User Experience**: Engaging, shareable personality test + authentic AI relationship
- **Privacy**: Global insights improve experience without compromising individual privacy
- **Evolution**: Natural relationship progression that feels authentic, not manipulative

## 🚀 Competitive Advantages
- **Data Network Effects**: Insights database becomes more valuable with more users
- **Relationship Lock-in**: Users invest in long-term relationship with evolving Hai
- **Complexity Moat**: Three-dimensional system requires significant AI/data science investment
- **Viral Mechanism**: Personality test drives organic growth while competitors rely on paid acquisition
- **Brand Differentiation**: "The AI that grows with you" is unique, defendable positioning
