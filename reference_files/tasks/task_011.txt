# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Three-Dimensional Personalization System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4, 6, 10, 21
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop and fully integrate the backend logic for the three-dimensional personalization system, combining personality archetypes, global AI insights, and evolution stage into a seamless, high-performance personalization engine. This system is the core competitive advantage, enabling impossible-to-replicate AI-driven user experiences.
# Details:
1. Implement get_hai_personality function as described in PRD
2. Integrate logic for retrieving and applying archetype-specific temperatures
3. Integrate system for selecting and applying relevant global AI insights
4. Implement evolution stage prompt modifications and context assembly
5. Combine all three dimensions (archetype, insights, evolution stage) into a unified personalization pipeline
6. Optimize context assembly for performance (target: <1 second)
7. Implement caching mechanism for frequently used personalization data
8. Ensure graceful degradation: system must handle failures in any dimension without breaking overall personalization

# Test Strategy:
1. Develop a comprehensive test suite covering the integration of all three personalization dimensions working together
2. Test context assembly performance to ensure response times are consistently under 1 second
3. Test correct application of archetype-specific temperatures
4. Test retrieval and application of global AI insights
5. Test evolution stage prompt modifications
6. Test system behavior and fallback mechanisms when any dimension fails (graceful degradation)
7. Benchmark personalization assembly performance and caching effectiveness

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Personality Function Requirements and TDD Scenarios [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Specify the requirements for the personality function dimension, including input parameters, expected outputs, and edge cases. Develop comprehensive test cases following the TDD approach.
### Details:
Gather user profile data requirements, define personality traits mapping, and write unit tests for all expected behaviors.

## 2. Implement and Test Personality Function Module [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Develop the personality function logic to pass all defined tests. Refactor as needed to ensure modularity and maintainability.
### Details:
Code the personality function, run tests, and iterate until all tests pass. Ensure clear separation of concerns for future integration.

## 3. Define Archetype Temperature Logic and TDD Scenarios [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Outline the requirements for archetype temperature logic, including how archetypes influence system behavior. Create detailed test cases for all logic branches.
### Details:
Document archetype categories, temperature parameters, and their effects. Write tests for each archetype-temperature combination.

## 4. Implement and Test Archetype Temperature Logic Module [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.3
### Description: Develop the archetype temperature logic to satisfy all TDD scenarios. Ensure the module is robust and ready for integration.
### Details:
Code the logic, execute tests, and refactor as necessary. Validate correct behavior for all archetype and temperature inputs.

## 5. Define Insight Selection Logic and TDD Scenarios [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Establish requirements for the insight selection dimension, including selection criteria and prioritization rules. Develop exhaustive test cases.
### Details:
List possible insights, define selection algorithms, and write tests for correct and edge-case selections.

## 6. Implement and Test Insight Selection Module [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.5
### Description: Build the insight selection logic to pass all TDD scenarios. Ensure the module is efficient and integrates cleanly with other dimensions.
### Details:
Implement selection algorithms, run tests, and refactor for clarity and performance.

## 7. Integrate Three Personalization Dimensions and Assemble Prompt Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.2, 11.4, 11.6
### Description: Combine the personality function, archetype temperature, and insight selection modules. Develop prompt assembly logic that leverages all three dimensions. Write integration and end-to-end tests.
### Details:
Design integration interfaces, assemble prompts using outputs from all modules, and validate with comprehensive integration tests.

## 8. Optimize Performance and Implement Caching with TDD [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Analyze performance bottlenecks in the integrated system. Design and implement caching strategies. Write performance and cache-coherency tests.
### Details:
Profile system, identify slow paths, implement caching layers, and ensure correctness and speedup with targeted tests.
