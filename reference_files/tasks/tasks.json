This includes provisioning a separate Supabase project for development (no shared data or credentials with production), robust environment variable management to ensure strict separation between dev and prod, automated CI/CD deployment for the dev branch, a safe workflow for live AI interaction testing, and reliable database seeding/migration for development. The current dev Heroku app and dev.fridaysatfour.co are incorrectly connected to the PROD Supabase—this must be fixed to enable safe, three-dimensional personalization testing.",

Implement strict environment variable management: use .env files for local, Vercel/Heroku secrets for cloud, and document all required variables. Ensure no secrets are committed to version control. Dev and prod must have fully separate credentials and endpoints.\n3. Automate environment setup using Docker Compose or similar tooling to guarantee consistency and reproducibility across developer machines and CI/CD. Use separate docker-compose configurations for dev and test environments as needed[2][5].\n4. Integrate CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions) for the dev branch: automate linting, testing, and deployment to dev environments, and ensure all secrets are injected securely at build time. Dev branch must auto-deploy to dev infrastructure only.\n5. Implement a safe AI testing workflow in the dev environment, ensuring no data or side effects reach production systems. Enable live testing of three-dimensional personalization features.\n6. Set up database seeding and migration for the dev Supabase project. Use Supabase CLI and migrations to keep dev schema up to date and seed with safe, non-production data[1][3][4].\n7. Configure monitoring and logging for the dev environment to track AI interactions and catch issues early, without leaking production data.\n8. Document the full setup process and provide onboarding instructions for new developers, emphasizing the separation between dev and prod.\n9.

Validate three-dimensional personalization features safely.\n- Review monitoring/logging outputs to ensure all activity is isolated to dev and no sensitive production data is exposed.\n- Onboard a new developer using the documentation and confirm they can set up and use the dev environment without accessing production resources.\n- Run database migrations and seeding scripts on the dev Supabase project and confirm schema and data are correct and isolated from production.",
