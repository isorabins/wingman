# User Project Overviews SQL Exports

This directory contains project plans and SQL files generated by the project plan insertion script.

## Purpose

When users want to add their project plans to the database, they can use the interactive script that creates permanent backup files and generates SQL for manual insertion.

## How It Works

### 1. Run the Script
```bash
python3 scripts/insert_project_plan.py
```

### 2. Interactive Process
The script will:
1. **Ask for user details** (ID and email for verification)
2. **Create a project file** with timestamp: `project_plan_[email]_[timestamp].txt`
3. **Open your text editor** automatically
4. **Wait for you to paste and save** your project plan
5. **Parse the project plan** when you close the editor
6. **Generate SQL file** for manual database insertion
7. **Keep both files permanently** as backups

### 3. Text Editor Experience
- File opens with helpful instructions
- Delete the instruction lines
- Paste your full project plan (no character limits!)
- Save and close the editor
- Script continues automatically

## File Organization

### Project Plan Files (Source)
- **Format**: `project_plan_[email]_[timestamp].txt`
- **Purpose**: Permanent backup of original project plans
- **Example**: `project_plan_christine_sarikas_20250102_143022.txt`

### SQL Files (Generated)
- **Format**: `insert_project_[project_name]_[timestamp].sql`
- **Purpose**: Ready-to-execute SQL for database insertion
- **Example**: `insert_project_the_jungle_witch_revision_20250102_143022.sql`

## SQL File Contents

Each generated SQL file includes:
- **User verification query** (to confirm the user exists)
- **INSERT statement** for the project_overview table with:
  - `user_id` (uuid)
  - `project_name` (text)
  - `project_type` (text)
  - `description` (text)
  - `goals` (array of strings)
  - `challenges` (array of strings)
  - `success_metrics` (JSON object)
- **Final verification query** (to confirm insertion worked)

## Benefits

✅ **No character limits** - use full text editor  
✅ **Permanent backups** - never lose project plans  
✅ **Safe manual insertion** - review before database changes  
✅ **Organized storage** - all files in one place  
✅ **Easy regeneration** - can create new SQL from saved plans  
✅ **Disaster recovery** - project plans safe even if database issues  

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```bash
python3 scripts/insert_project_plan.py
# Enter: 6de78e0b-86bc-4585-b991-910b2b2b7a3b
# Enter: christine.sarikas@gmail.com
# [Text editor opens]
# [Paste project plan, save, close]
# [SQL file generated]
```

### Files Created

├── insert_project_the_jungle_witch_revision_20250102_143022.sql
└── README.md
```

## Next Steps After SQL Generation

1. **Review the SQL file** - check all data looks correct
2. **Copy SQL content** - from the generated file
3. **Open Supabase SQL editor** - in your dashboard
4. **Paste and execute** - the SQL statements
5. **Verify insertion** - check the project_overview table

## Troubleshooting

- **Editor doesn't open**: Check your system's default text editor
- **File empty after editing**: Make sure you saved before closing
- **Parsing errors**: Check project plan format matches expected structure
- **SQL errors**: Verify user_id exists in the database first
