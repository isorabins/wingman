# Dependency Update Guide for Fridays at Four

This document provides guidance for updating the Python version and dependencies for the Fridays at Four project. Your task is to modernize the codebase's dependencies without breaking functionality, and to provide a reasonable time estimate for the work.

## Current State

- **Python Version**: 3.11
- **Key Dependencies**: See `requirements.txt` (examine this file to understand current dependencies and their versions)
- **Technical Debt**: The application has accumulated technical debt related to outdated packages and potential security vulnerabilities
- **Target State**: Python 3.12+ with all dependencies updated to their latest stable versions that maintain compatibility

## Scope of Work

Your responsibilities include:

1. **Analysis**
   - Review the current `requirements.txt` file
   - Identify outdated packages
   - Check for security vulnerabilities
   - Map dependency relationships

2. **Execution**
   - Update Python version to 3.12+
   - Update dependencies to their latest stable versions
   - Resolve any conflicts that arise
   - Test to ensure functionality is maintained

3. **Testing & Validation**
   - Basic testing to ensure no conflicts
   - Verify core functionality works after updates
   - Check integration points still function

4. **Documentation**
   - Update requirements.txt with new versions
   - Document any changes required to make dependencies work

## Methodology for Updates

1. **Create a Dedicated Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout dev
   git pull
   git checkout -b feature/dependency-updates
   ```

2. **Set Up Testing Environment**
   - Create a fresh virtual environment
   - Install current dependencies for baseline testing
   - Run basic tests to ensure they pass in the current state

3. **Python Version Update**
   - Install Python 3.12+
   - Update dependencies as needed
   - Resolve any compatibility issues

4. **Basic Testing Checklist**
   - Core functionality tests
   - Slack message handling
   - Zoom integration
   - Database operations 
   - AI model interactions
   - Redis functionality

## Areas to Monitor

Pay attention to these components when updating:

1. **AI API Clients**
   - OpenAI and Anthropic client compatibility
   - Changes in request/response formats

2. **Database Connectors**
   - Supabase client compatibility
   - Database operation functionality

3. **Slack and Zoom Integrations**
   - API client compatibility
   - Event handling functionality

4. **Redis Client**
   - Connection handling
   - Data storage/retrieval

## Deliverables

Please provide the following:

1. **Your time estimate** for completing this task (detailed breakdown preferred)
2. A list of updated dependencies with version changes
3. A pull request with all updates
4. Documentation of any implementation changes required

## Testing Requirements

After updates, verify:

1. Core functionality works
2. Message processing functions correctly
3. Slack and Zoom integrations work
4. Database operations work correctly
5. AI interactions function properly
