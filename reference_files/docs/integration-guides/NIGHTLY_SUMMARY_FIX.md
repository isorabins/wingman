# Nightly Summary Bug Fix Documentation

## üêõ The Issue

The nightly summaries weren't being generated even though:
1. The code was working correctly in tests
2. The Heroku Scheduler was configured and running
3. Users had conversations to summarize

### Root Cause

The bug was in the date logic of `nightly_summary_job.py`:

```python
# OLD CODE (BUGGY)
base_date = target_date or datetime.now(timezone.utc).replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)
```

This defaulted to processing **TODAY's** conversations. But when the Heroku Scheduler runs at midnight UTC:
- It's exactly 12:00 AM UTC
- "Today" just started 0 seconds ago
- There are NO conversations for "today" yet
- The conversations to summarize are from YESTERDAY

### Why Tests Passed

The tests passed because they:
1. Explicitly created conversations with specific timestamps
2. Ran the summarizer with explicit dates
3. Didn't test the default behavior when no date is specified
4. Didn't simulate the exact midnight UTC execution context

## ‚úÖ The Fix

Updated the date logic to default to YESTERDAY when no date is specified:

```python
# FIXED CODE
if target_date is None:
    # When run by scheduler after midnight, we want yesterday's data
    base_date = (datetime.now(timezone.utc) - timedelta(days=1)).replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)
    logger.info("No target date specified, defaulting to YESTERDAY for scheduled run")
else:
    base_date = target_date.replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)
```

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

1. **Test the fix locally**:
   ```bash
   # Run for yesterday (should find conversations)
   python src/nightly_summary_job.py --test
   
   # Check summary stats
   python src/nightly_summary_job.py --check
   ```

2. **Deploy to production**:
   ```bash
   git add src/nightly_summary_job.py
   git commit -m "fix: nightly summary job now correctly processes yesterday's conversations by default"
   git push heroku main
   ```

3. **Manually run for missed dates** (if needed):
   ```bash
   # On Heroku
   heroku run python src/nightly_summary_job.py --date 2025-01-28 --app fridays-at-four
   heroku run python src/nightly_summary_job.py --date 2025-01-27 --app fridays-at-four
   # etc...
   ```

## üß™ Test Coverage Improvements

Created new tests to prevent this regression:

1. **`test_scheduler_integration.py`** - Tests the exact scenario where scheduler runs at midnight
2. **`check_scheduler_status.py`** - Diagnostic script to check summary generation status

## üîç Monitoring

To monitor if summaries are being generated:

```bash
# Check yesterday's summary generation
python scripts/check_scheduler_status.py

# Check specific date stats
python src/nightly_summary_job.py --check
```

## üìù Key Learnings

1. **Test the actual deployment scenario** - Tests should mimic production execution context
2. **Consider timezone and timing edge cases** - Midnight UTC is a special case
3. **Add monitoring/diagnostics** - Make it easy to verify scheduled jobs are working
4. **Document scheduler configuration** - Keep track of what's scheduled and when

## üéØ Prevention

To prevent similar issues:

1. Always test scheduled jobs with their default parameters
2. Test at the exact time they'll run in production
3. Add logging that clearly shows what date range is being processed
4. Create diagnostic tools to verify job execution
5. Consider using explicit date parameters in scheduler commands as backup

## Alternative Solutions (Not Implemented)

1. **Change Heroku Scheduler command** to explicitly pass yesterday:
   ```bash
   python nightly_summary_job.py --date $(date -u -d "yesterday" +%Y-%m-%d)
   ```

2. **Run scheduler at a different time** (e.g., 2 AM UTC instead of midnight)

3. **Use a more robust date calculation** that accounts for the execution time

The code fix was chosen because it's the most reliable and doesn't require scheduler reconfiguration.
