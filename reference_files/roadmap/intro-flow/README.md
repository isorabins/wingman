# 🚀 Intro Flow - Future Enhancement

## 📋 Overview
This folder contains the complete intro flow implementation that was developed but moved out of MVP scope. The intro flow was designed to provide a structured onboarding experience before users enter the main creativity test and project planning flows.

## 🎯 Current MVP Strategy
For MVP, we skip the intro flow and go directly to:
1. **Creativity Test** (11 questions) 
2. **Project Overview** (8 topics)
3. **Main Chat**

## 📁 Folder Structure
```

├── agents/                    # IntroAgent class implementation
├── handlers/                  # Intro flow handler logic  
├── tests/                     # Test files for intro flow

└── README.md                  # This file
```

## 📚 Documentation Contents
- **intro flow agents implementation guide.md** - Complete implementation guide
- **intro_flow_implementation.md** - Production-ready implementation  
- **intro-flow-implementation-guide-opus.md** - Alternative implementation approach
- **intro-flow-research.md** - Research and user experience insights
- **INTELLIGENT_INTRO_IMPLEMENTATION.md** - AI-powered intro conversation design

## 🔮 Future Implementation
When ready to implement intro flow in the future:
1. Review the documentation in `docs/` folder
2. Integrate the handlers and agents back into main codebase  
3. Update database schema as needed
4. Add intro flow endpoints back to main.py
5. Update frontend to support intro flow routing

## ⚠️ Current Status
- **Code Status**: Complete but not integrated in MVP
- **Database**: No intro flow specific tables needed currently
- **Testing**: Comprehensive tests available in tests/ folder
- **Documentation**: Fully documented implementation approaches

*Reason: Not essential for MVP, can be added as future enhancement*
