Executive Summary
Vision: Transform the existing Fridays at Four creative project management platform into WingmanMatch, a revolutionary dating confidence app that combines AI coaching with real-world wingman partnerships to help men overcome approach anxiety and build genuine connection skills.
Core Insight: The infrastructure built for creative accountability (AI memory, human partnerships, progress tracking) maps perfectly to dating confidence building. We're not rebuilding - we're strategically adapting proven systems.
Timeline: 2-3 week MVP using 80% existing code

1. PRODUCT OVERVIEW
Current State: Fridays at Four

Purpose: AI project manager + human accountability for creative projects
Core Features:

Hai (AI assistant) with full conversation memory
Human email buddy matching for weekly check-ins

ADAPT WITH MINIMAL CHANGES
Agent System Transformation:
python# FROM: creativity_agent.py 
# TO: confidence_agent.py

Old: CreativityTestAgent with 6 creative archetypes
New: ConfidenceTestAgent with 6 dating archetypes
- Questions about creative process → Questions about approach style
- Same 12-question flow
- Same scoring logic
- Same progress tracking
-use this as dating archytpe and dating goals - we dont want too many tests
# FROM: project_overview_agent.py
# TO: wingman_profile_agent.py

Old: 8 topics about creative project
-this gets rolled into the one test above

New: 8 topics about dating goals
1. Project Vision → Dating Goals
2. Project Type → Experience Level
3. Target Audience → Type of Women You Like
4. Personal Goals → What Success Looks Like
5. Current Challenges → What's Holding You Back
6. Timeline → Availability for Wingman Sessions
7. Resources → Current Strengths
8. Next Steps → First Challenge You'll Take
Database Schema Adaptations:
sql-- KEEP existing tables, ADD new ones:
-this rolled into one test of 12 questions

-- Rename contexts:
creator_profiles → user_profiles (keep structure)
project_overview → dating_goals (same structure, different content)
creativity_test_results → confidence_test_results

-- ADD new tables:

    id: 1,
    question: "You see someone attractive at a coffee shop. What actually happens?",
    options: [
      "I imagine 47 scenarios but never move",

    4. "Schedule Session" with:
       - Venue selector (coffee shops, bookstores)
       - Time picker
       - Challenge selector
       -tehy should be able to chat with eachother to setup meeting. maybe 
       they get eachothers numbers if chat is hard to setup. its 
       prob not hard tought right?
  }
}

  }
}
-I think panic mode is overkill for MVP lets leave it out

2.3 Prompt Engineering Changes
Main System Prompt (prompts.py)
python# FROM: Hai helping with creative projects
main_prompt = """You are Hai, helping creators finish projects..."""

# TO: Connell Barrett coaching dating confidence
main_prompt = """You are Connell Barrett, a dating coach who actually gets it...

You've helped thousands of men overcome approach anxiety by understanding 
that confidence isn't about being someone else - it's about being the best 
version of yourself.

Core principles:
- Authenticity beats any 'technique'
- Confidence is a skill that improves with practice
- Every approach is a win, regardless of outcome
- The goal is connection, not conquest

You remember everything about their journey:
- Their confidence assessment results
- Every approach they've attempted
- What specifically triggers their anxiety
- What's worked and what hasn't
- Their wingman session history
"""

# Guest chat becomes approach planning
guest_prompt = """You are Connell Barrett helping someone plan their first approach.

In 5-10 messages, help them:
1. Identify their specific anxiety
2. Reframe their mindset
3. Create a simple action plan
4. Build genuine confidence

End with a specific challenge they can do TODAY.

4. DATA MIGRATION STRATEGY
User Migration Path

Existing F@4 Users:

Email about pivot with special offer
Keep their account, prompt for dating profile completion
Preserve their conversation history (could be interesting data)


Database Migration:
sql-- Don't delete anything, just add context flags
ALTER TABLE creator_profiles ADD COLUMN product_version VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'f4';

-- New users get 'wingman' flag
-- Can query by product version for analytics

Gradual Transition:

Keep F@4 running at old subdomain (legacy.fridaysatfour.co)
New signups go to WingmanMatch
Existing users can access both with same login




5. RISK MITIGATION
Technical Risks
RiskMitigationLocation services complexityStart with city-level matching, add precise location laterReal-time coordinationUse existing Redis infrastructure, add WebSockets if neededPrompt personality shiftA/B test Connell responses with beta usersDatabase migration errorsKeep full backups, test on staging first
Product Risks
RiskMitigationUsers not showing up to sessionsDeposit system or reputation scoresSafety concernsVerify users, public venue requirementsUneven geographic distributionStart in specific cities (Austin, NYC, SF)Gender imbalanceMale-only initially, expand later
Business Risks
RiskMitigationAlienating existing F@4 usersKeep F@4 running, position as expansionDating app saturationPosition as confidence building, not datingSeasonal usage patternsAdd virtual challenges for off-peak times

6. SUCCESS METRICS
Week 1 Success Criteria

 100% of existing tests passing with new prompts
 Assessment completion rate >80%
 Chat engagement similar to F@4 baseline

Week 2 Success Criteria

 Location permission grant rate >60%
 Match acceptance rate >40%
 Challenge completion rate >30%
 Panic button usage (shows engagement)

Week 3 Success Criteria

 50+ beta users signed up

CONCLUSION
WingmanMatch is not a pivot - it's an evolution. We're taking proven infrastructure for human connection and accountability and applying it to an even more universal problem. The technical lift is minimal (2-3 weeks), the market is massive (every single guy struggles with approach anxiety), and we have unique advantages (AI + human accountability) that no one else is combining.
The beautiful part: If this works, we've cracked the code on AI-assisted human connection. This same framework could expand to public speaking, networking events, job interviews - any situation where people need confidence + accountability.
Let's build the world's first AI-powered wingman service. 🚀
