  - Already adapted from project overview agent pattern
  
- [x] **Review project patterns** - COMPLETED
  - BaseAgent inheritance pattern understood
  - Memory integration patterns identified
  - FastAPI endpoint patterns analyzed

## Phase 2: Database Schema Implementation ✅
- [x] **Create dating_goals table migration**
  - Added goals_data JSONB column to existing dating_goals table
  - Created dating_goals_progress table for flow tracking
  - Added proper foreign keys and constraints
  
- [x] **Validate schema compatibility**
  - Migration applied successfully
  - Foreign key relationships working
  - RLS policies created for security

## Phase 3: API Endpoint Implementation ✅
- [x] **Implement POST /api/dating-goals endpoint**
  - Full conversation flow with WingmanProfileAgent
  - Claude API integration working
  - Auto-dependency creation for users
  
- [x] **Implement GET /api/dating-goals/{user_id} endpoint**
  - Retrieves stored dating goals data
  - Proper error handling for missing data
  - Returns structured response format
  
- [x] **Add Pydantic models**
  - DatingGoalsRequest model with validation
  - DatingGoalsResponse model with progress tracking
  - DatingGoalsDataResponse for retrieval
  - UUID validation patterns

- [x] **Add error handling and validation**
  - Comprehensive input validation
  - Database error handling with graceful fallback
  - HTTP 400/404/500 status codes
  - Detailed error messages

## Phase 4: Memory Integration ✅
- [x] **Add goals to conversation context**
  - Integrated with WingmanMemory system
  - Dating goals added to coaching context
  - Context formatting for AI awareness
  
- [x] **Validate coach awareness**
  - Goals included in coaching context
  - Memory integration working
  - No conflicts with existing memory patterns

## Phase 5: Testing & Validation ✅
- [x] **API testing**
  - POST endpoint: 200 OK with Connell Barrett coaching response
  - GET endpoint: 200 OK with structured goals data
  - DELETE endpoint: Implemented (has table cache issue)
  - Authentication and error scenarios working
  
- [x] **Integration testing**
  - Complete workflow from POST → conversation → memory storage
  - Claude API integration successful
  - User auto-creation working
  
- [x] **Real-world validation**
  - Tested with development server
  - Actual Anthropic API calls working
  - Database operations successful

## Phase 6: Documentation & Completion ✅
- [x] **Implementation completed**
  - All core functionality delivered
  - API endpoints operational
  - Memory integration working
  - Agent providing quality coaching responses

## Current Status: Phase 1 Complete ✅

**Discoveries from Analysis:**
- `src/agents/wingman_profile_agent.py` already exists and is well-implemented
- Agent has 4 dating-focused topics (not 8 like project overview)
- Topics are: Goals & Targets, Past Attempts, Triggers & Comfort Zones, Next Steps
- Agent uses proper BaseAgent inheritance and patterns
- **Next**: Need to implement database schema and API endpoints

## Immediate Next Actions:
1. Create dating_goals table migration
2. Implement POST /api/dating-goals endpoint in main.py
3. Add Pydantic models for request/response validation
4. Test API endpoint functionality

## Implementation Notes:
- Agent is already properly adapted for dating confidence context
- Focus on database and API implementation
- Memory integration will use existing SimpleMemory patterns
- Follow FastAPI patterns from existing endpoints in main.py
