- `POST /coach/attempt` - Record approach attempt outcomes
- `GET /coach/challenges` - Get available challenges by difficulty/type
- `GET /coach/progress/{user_id}` - Track user confidence progress
- `GET /coach/sessions/{user_id}` - Retrieve coaching session history
- `GET /coach/health` - Health check for Claude agent system

## Key Design Decisions

### Connell Barrett Persona Implementation
- **Temperature 0.7**: More creative than reference 0.6 for authentic coaching warmth
- **Top_p 0.9**: Balanced sampling for natural conversation flow
- **Prompt Integration**: Existing prompts.py contains full Connell Barrett persona
- **Archetype Support**: Integrated with existing archetype system for personalized coaching
- **Safety Boundaries**: Built-in guardrails against pickup tactics and toxic masculinity

### Model Configuration Strategy
```python
# Primary Model: Claude 3.5 Sonnet for coaching quality
COACHING_MODEL = "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"
TEMPERATURE = 0.7  # Warmer than reference for coaching authenticity
TOP_P = 0.9       # Natural conversation flow
MAX_TOKENS = 2048 # Optimized for streaming responses
```

### Memory Architecture
```python
# Memory hooks for dating confidence coaching
CONTEXT_HOOKS = {
    "assessment_results": "confidence test scores and archetype",
    "attempts": "approach attempts and outcomes", 
    "triggers": "fear patterns and anxiety points",
    "session_history": "coaching breakthroughs and progress"
}
```

## Integration Patterns

### Database Integration
- ✅ **Existing Patterns**: Uses SupabaseFactory from src/database.py
- ✅ **Retry Resilience**: Integrated with src/retry_utils.py for robust operations
- ✅ **WingmanMatch Schema**: Supports user_profiles, approach_challenges, coaching_sessions
- ✅ **Auto-dependency Creation**: Prevents foreign key constraint violations

### API Architecture
- ✅ **FastAPI Integration**: Seamless integration with existing main.py structure
- ✅ **CORS Support**: Existing CORS middleware supports coaching endpoints
- ✅ **Rate Limiting**: Existing rate limiting applies to coaching endpoints
- ✅ **Streaming Support**: Server-sent events for real-time coaching experience

### Error Handling & Monitoring  
- ✅ **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logging for debugging and monitoring
- ✅ **Graceful Fallbacks**: System continues operating when Claude API unavailable
- ✅ **Health Checks**: Dedicated endpoints for system health monitoring
