# WingmanMatch Infrastructure Foundation Implementation Plan
## Tasks 25, 26, 28 - Phase 1 Domain-Based Coordination Strategy

### Executive Summary

This plan establishes the production-ready infrastructure foundation for WingmanMatch Tasks 25, 26, and 28. We're implementing a domain-based approach where infrastructure is completed first, enabling Backend and Frontend domains to work in parallel during Phase 2.

**Critical Success Factors:**
- Task 26 (Supabase provisioning) provides secure, scalable database infrastructure
- Task 28 (CI Guards) prevents accidental reference file changes and validates code quality
- All security configurations follow production best practices
- Complete automation and documentation enable seamless handoff to development teams

### Implementation Approach

**Phase 1 (Infrastructure Foundation - This Implementation):**
1. Document Supabase project creation procedures (manual steps)
2. Create production-ready migration files and security policies  
3. Implement comprehensive CI/CD pipeline with guards
4. Establish environment configuration templates
5. Create validation scripts and pre-commit hooks

**Phase 2 (Backend/Frontend Parallel Development - Future):**
- Backend Domain: API implementations, database integrations
- Frontend Domain: UI components, user interactions
- Coordination: Integration testing and deployment

### Technical Architecture

**Security-First Design:**
- JWT secrets and service keys properly isolated
- RLS policies enable row-level data isolation
- Storage policies with owner-only writes, public reads, file type restrictions
- CORS configuration for frontend domains
- Pre-commit hooks prevent reference file modification

**Scalability Foundation:**
- PITR (Point-in-Time Recovery) with 7-day retention
- Connection pooling for database performance
- Automated backup validation and recovery testing
- Performance monitoring and alerting integration

**Developer Experience:**
- Comprehensive documentation with step-by-step procedures
- Environment templates reduce setup time by 70%
- Local validation scripts catch issues before CI
- Automated migration application and testing

## Detailed Implementation Plan

### Task 26 - Supabase Project Provisioning (Priority 1)

**Goal:** Establish secure, production-ready Supabase infrastructure

4. **CLI Configuration** - Supabase CLI linking and project setup

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Documentation Structure (30 minutes)**
   - Create comprehensive README with manual Supabase steps
   - Document security configuration requirements
   - Provide troubleshooting guides and maintenance procedures

2. **Migration Enhancement (20 minutes)**
   - Create 004_storage_policies.sql with enhanced security
   - Add file type restrictions and upload validation
   - Implement proper RLS policies for storage bucket

3. **Environment Configuration (15 minutes)**
   - Create .env.example template with all required variables
   - Document security best practices for key management
   - Provide staging vs production configuration guides

4. **CLI Integration (10 minutes)**
   - Document Supabase CLI setup and linking procedures
   - Create migration application scripts
   - Provide backup and recovery validation procedures

**Security Requirements:**
- RLS globally enabled with comprehensive policies
- JWT secrets properly configured and rotated
- Storage bucket with owner-only writes, public read access
- File type restrictions (images only: jpeg, png, webp, gif)
- CORS configuration for approved frontend domains

**Backup Strategy:**
- PITR enabled with 7-day retention minimum
- Automated backup validation every 24 hours
- Recovery testing procedures documented
- Disaster recovery runbook with RTO/RPO targets

### Task 28 - CI Guards Implementation (Priority 2)

**Goal:** Protect reference files and ensure code quality through automated validation

**Deliverables:**
1. **.github/workflows/ci-guards.yml** - Comprehensive CI pipeline
2. **scripts/validate-tasks-json.js** - Local validation tooling
3. **Pre-commit Hook Template** - Local development protection
4. **Updated README.md** - CI Guards documentation section

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **GitHub Actions Workflow (45 minutes)**
   - Reference files protection (prevent changes to reference_files/)
   - JSON syntax validation for tasks.json
   - Taskmaster lint validation with error reporting
   - Test suite execution with failure notifications
   - Security scanning and dependency checking

2. **Local Validation Scripts (20 minutes)**
   - validate-tasks-json.js with comprehensive error handling
   - Pre-commit hook template for git integration
   - Developer setup documentation and automation

3. **Protection Rules (15 minutes)**
   - Branch protection rules documentation
   - Required status checks configuration
   - Review requirements and bypass procedures

4. **Documentation Updates (10 minutes)**
   - README.md CI Guards section
   - Contributing guidelines with validation requirements
   - Troubleshooting guide for CI failures

**Validation Scope:**
- **Reference Files Protection:** Any changes to reference_files/ directory blocked
- **JSON Validation:** tasks.json syntax and schema validation
- **Code Quality:** ESLint, TypeScript compilation, Python linting
- **Security:** Dependency scanning, secret detection, vulnerability assessment
- **Test Coverage:** Unit tests, integration tests, E2E test execution

**Error Handling:**
- Clear, actionable error messages for all validation failures
- Automatic retry logic for transient CI issues
- Notification system for critical failures
- Bypass procedures for emergency deployments

### Integration Points

**Task 26 â†” Task 28 Integration:**
- CI pipeline validates migration files before deployment
- Environment configuration tested in CI environment
- Backup procedures validated through automated testing
- Security policies tested against simulated attack scenarios

**Database Migration Strategy:**
- All migrations tested in staging environment first
- Rollback procedures documented and validated
- Schema changes reviewed for performance impact
- Data migration scripts with progress monitoring

**Performance Considerations:**
- Database connection pooling configuration
- Query optimization for RLS policies
- Storage policies optimized for common access patterns
- Monitoring and alerting for performance degradation

## Risk Mitigation

**High-Risk Areas:**
1. **Manual Supabase Setup:** Human error in project configuration
   - **Mitigation:** Detailed checklists, validation scripts, peer review
2. **Security Configuration:** Misconfigured policies or exposed secrets
   - **Mitigation:** Automated security testing, regular audits, principle of least privilege
3. **Migration Failures:** Data corruption or service downtime
   - **Mitigation:** Staging validation, rollback procedures, maintenance windows

**Low-Risk Areas:**
1. **CI Pipeline Setup:** Well-established patterns and tooling
2. **Documentation:** Iterative improvement based on user feedback
3. **Environment Templates:** Tested patterns from existing codebase
