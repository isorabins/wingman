   - ReputationBadge (complex calculations)
   - MatchCard (profile data rendering)

2. **Create Lazy Loading Infrastructure**
   - Implement `LazyComponents.tsx` with React.lazy()
   - Add loading fallbacks and error boundaries
   - Create progressive loading with skeleton UI

3. **Component Optimization**
   - Wrap heavy components in lazy loading
   - Add Suspense boundaries with meaningful loading states
   - Implement progressive enhancement patterns

**Deliverables**:

- Skeleton UI components for loading states

### Phase 3: Route-Level Code Splitting (45 minutes)
**Goal**: Implement Next.js dynamic imports to split code by route

**Tasks**:
1. **Dynamic Route Imports**
   - Convert static imports to dynamic() for non-critical pages
   - Implement route-based code splitting for /dating-goals, /session/[id], /buddy-chat
   - Add preloading for likely next pages

2. **Smart Preloading Strategy**
   - Implement intelligent prefetching based on user journey
   - Add intersection observer for link preloading
   - Create user flow-based preloading (confidence → profile → matching)

3. **Route Optimization**
   - Optimize page components for tree-shaking
   - Reduce dependencies per route
   - Implement route-specific performance monitoring

**Deliverables**:
- Dynamic imports for all non-critical routes
- Intelligent preloading system
- Route-specific performance tracking

### Phase 4: Dependency Optimization (60 minutes)
**Goal**: Optimize Chakra UI bundle and implement aggressive tree-shaking

**Tasks**:
1. **Chakra UI Optimization**
   - Implement selective imports for Chakra components
   - Create custom theme with only needed components
   - Replace heavy Chakra components with lighter alternatives

2. **Bundle Tree-Shaking**
   - Configure webpack for aggressive tree-shaking
   - Remove unused Emotion dependencies
   - Optimize Framer Motion imports (motion.div only)
   - Replace heavy date libraries with lightweight alternatives

3. **Dependency Audit**
   - Remove unused dependencies from package.json
   - Replace heavy libraries with lighter alternatives
   - Implement dynamic imports for third-party libraries

**Deliverables**:
- Optimized Chakra UI configuration
- Enhanced webpack tree-shaking config
- Reduced dependency footprint

### Phase 5: Advanced Performance Features (60 minutes)
**Goal**: Implement service worker, advanced caching, and perceived performance enhancements

**Tasks**:
1. **Service Worker Implementation**

   - Implement stale-while-revalidate strategy for API calls
   - Add background sync for form submissions

2. **Advanced Caching Strategy**
   - Implement smart cache with TTL management
   - Add cache warming for critical resources
   - Create cache invalidation strategy

3. **Perceived Performance Enhancement**
   - Implement skeleton loading for all async operations
   - Add progressive image loading with LQIP (Low Quality Image Placeholders)
   - Create smooth page transitions

4. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Implement real-time performance tracking
   - Add Core Web Vitals monitoring
   - Create performance alerts for regression detection
