# Task: Update Memory Bank & Create System Flow Visualization

## Objective
Update WingmanMatch memory bank files with Task 5 (Confidence Assessment) completion and create comprehensive system flow visualization.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Memory Bank Updates

#### 1. Update activeContext.md
- Move Task 5 from "Next Priority" to "âœ… Completed"  
- Add Task 5 implementation details:
  - 12-question assessment flow
  - 6 archetypes (Analyzer, Sprinter, Ghost, Scholar, Naturalist, Protector)
  - ConfidenceTestAgent operational
  - Database schema with confidence_test_results and progress tables
- Update "Current Work Focus" to reflect Task 5 completion, ready for Task 6
- Update system status with new operational components

#### 2. Update systemPatterns.md  
- Add new "Assessment Architecture" section
- Document ConfidenceTestAgent pattern and BaseAgent inheritance
- Add assessment flow patterns and archetype scoring system
- Document database integration patterns for assessments
- Add confidence scoring functions as reusable patterns

#### 3. Update techContext.md
- Add confidence assessment components to project structure
- Update development commands for assessment testing
- Add new dependencies and database migration info
- Document assessment API endpoints (ready for Phase 3)

### Phase 2: System Flow Visualization

#### 1. Create SYSTEM_FLOW_VISUALIZATION.md
- Complete WingmanMatch architecture diagram
- User journey from registration â†’ assessment â†’ buddy matching â†’ coaching
- All implemented components (Tasks 1-5) with current status
- Database relationships and data flow
- API endpoints and agent interactions

#### 2. Assessment Flow Diagrams
- 12-question conversation flow with ConfidenceTestAgent
- Archetype classification process (scoring â†’ primary archetype)
- Database storage and profile updates
- Progress tracking and session management

#### 3. Implementation Status Matrix
- âœ… Completed: Environment, Database, Backend Services, AI Coach, Assessment
- ðŸŸ¡ Ready: Testing framework, Email templates
- ðŸ”´ Pending: Frontend, Buddy Matching, Session Coordination

#### 4. Data Flow Architecture
- Assessment data flow: User â†’ Agent â†’ Scoring â†’ Database â†’ Profile
- Coaching data flow: Memory â†’ Context â†’ Claude API â†’ Response â†’ Memory
- Future buddy matching flow: Profiles â†’ Algorithm â†’ Matches â†’ Sessions

## Success Criteria

âœ… Memory bank accurately reflects Task 5 completion  
âœ… System patterns documented for assessment architecture  
âœ… Technical context updated with new components  
âœ… Comprehensive system flow visualization created  
âœ… Clear implementation status across all tasks  
âœ… Data flow diagrams show current and planned architecture  

## Dependencies
- Existing memory bank structure
- Task 5 implementation report
- Current project architecture understanding

## Timeline
- Phase 1: Memory bank updates (30 minutes)
- Phase 2: System flow visualization (45 minutes)
- Total: ~75 minutes

This plan ensures comprehensive documentation of Task 5 completion while creating valuable system visualization for development planning.
