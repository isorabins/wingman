- **Impact**: Continuous performance visibility and improvement tracking

## Technical Architecture Implemented

### Lazy Loading Strategy
```typescript
// Heavy page components now lazy-loaded
export const LazyConfidenceTest = dynamic(() => import('../app/confidence-test/page'), {
  loading: () => <ConfidenceTestSkeleton />,
  ssr: false // Assessment is interactive, no SSR benefit
})

export const LazyBuddyChat = dynamic(() => import('../app/buddy-chat/[matchId]/page'), {
  loading: () => <ChatSkeleton />,
  ssr: false // Real-time chat requires client-side rendering
})
```

### Intelligent Prefetching
```typescript
// Journey-based prefetching patterns
private readonly JOURNEY_PATTERNS = {
  '/confidence-test': ['/dating-goals', '/profile-setup', '/find-buddy'],
  '/dating-goals': ['/find-buddy', '/matches'],
  '/buddy-chat': ['/session'],
}
```

### Performance Monitoring
```typescript
// Web Vitals tracking with backend integration
const performanceMetric: PerformanceMetric = {
  name: metric.name,
  value: metric.value,
  rating: this.getRating(metric.name, metric.value),
  timestamp: Date.now(),
  url: window.location.href,
}
```
