# Domain-Based Agent Integration Strategy

## Overview
Transform the current task-by-task agent approach into domain-based agent coordination where each domain agent understands their entire technology stack from end-to-end.

### Planning Agents
- **kiro-plan.md**: Implementation task planner from approved designs
- **kiro-design.md**: Feature design creation
- **kiro-requirement.md**: Requirements gathering

## Problems with Current Approach

### Task-by-Task Limitations
1. **Context Fragmentation**: Each agent only sees their specific task
2. **Pattern Inconsistency**: No full-domain understanding leads to inconsistent implementation patterns
3. **Handoff Overhead**: Multiple context switches between agents
4. **Missing Dependencies**: Agents can't anticipate downstream requirements
5. **Architectural Drift**: No single agent owns end-to-end domain integrity

### Example Current Flow Problems
```
Task 1: Backend Agent → Create API endpoint (doesn't know frontend needs)
Task 2: Frontend Agent → Build UI (discovers API doesn't provide needed data)
Task 3: Backend Agent → Modify API (breaks existing frontend assumptions)
```

## Domain-Based Solution

### Domain Architecture
Transform agents into domain specialists with full-stack awareness:

```
Frontend Domain Agent
├── Complete UI/UX understanding
├── Component architecture patterns
├── State management strategies
├── API consumption patterns
├── Performance optimization
├── Testing strategies
└── User journey orchestration

Backend Domain Agent  
├── Complete API architecture
├── Database design patterns
├── Business logic organization
├── Authentication/authorization
├── Performance optimization
├── Testing strategies
└── Integration patterns

Database Domain Agent
├── Schema design and evolution
├── Migration strategies
├── Query optimization
├── Data modeling patterns
├── Backup and recovery
├── Performance tuning
└── Security policies

Infrastructure Domain Agent
├── Deployment strategies
├── Monitoring and logging
├── Security configurations
├── Performance optimization
├── Scaling strategies
├── DevOps automation
└── Environment management
```

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. Enhanced Kiro Planning Agent Integration

#### Current Kiro-Plan Modifications
Add domain-awareness instructions to `/Users/isorabins/.claude/agents/kiro-plan.md`:

```markdown
## Domain-Based Planning Enhancement

### Domain Separation Strategy
When creating implementation plans, organize tasks by domain for end-to-end agent ownership:

**Frontend Domain Tasks**
- All UI components, user interactions, state management
- Complete user journey implementation
- Frontend performance optimization
- Client-side testing and validation

**Backend Domain Tasks**  
- All API endpoints, business logic, data processing
- Complete service architecture
- Backend performance optimization
- Server-side testing and integration

**Database Domain Tasks**
- Schema design, migrations, query optimization
- Data modeling and relationships
- Database performance tuning
- Data integrity and security

**Infrastructure Domain Tasks**
- Deployment, monitoring, security configuration
- Environment setup and management
- Performance monitoring and scaling
- DevOps automation

### Agent Assignment Pattern
Instead of:
```
Task 1: Create API endpoint → backend-developer
Task 2: Create UI component → frontend-developer  
Task 3: Update database → backend-developer
```

Use:
```
Frontend Domain: Complete user authentication flow → frontend-domain-agent
Backend Domain: Complete authentication system → backend-domain-agent
Database Domain: User management schema → database-domain-agent
```

### Domain Planning Template
For each domain, include:

1. **Complete Domain Understanding**
   - Technology stack and patterns
   - Integration points with other domains
   - Performance requirements
   - Testing strategies

2. **Implementation Sequence**
   - Logical build order within domain
   - Integration checkpoints
   - Testing milestones

3. **Cross-Domain Dependencies**
   - Required APIs from backend
   - Data requirements from database
   - Infrastructure needs

4. **Domain Success Criteria**
   - Functional requirements
   - Performance benchmarks
   - Quality gates
```

### 2. Agent Profile Enhancements

#### Frontend Domain Agent Profile
Enhance `frontend-developer.md` with domain ownership:

```markdown
# Frontend Domain Agent - Complete UI Stack Owner

## Domain Ownership
You own the ENTIRE frontend domain from user interaction to API integration:

### Full Stack Awareness

### Domain Planning Approach
When assigned a domain task:

1. **Analyze Complete Requirements**
   - Review ALL frontend requirements for the feature
   - Understand integration points with backend/database
   - Identify reusable patterns and components

2. **Design Complete Architecture**

```

#### Backend Domain Agent Profile  
Enhance `backend-developer.md` with domain ownership:

```markdown

## Domain Ownership
You own the ENTIRE backend domain from API design to data processing:

### Full Stack Awareness
- **API Architecture**: Complete service design and integration patterns
- **Business Logic**: Domain modeling and processing workflows
- **Data Access**: Repository patterns and database optimization
- **Authentication/Authorization**: Complete security implementation
- **Performance**: Caching, optimization, and scaling strategies

### Domain Planning Approach
When assigned a domain task:

1. **Analyze Complete Requirements**
   - Review ALL backend requirements for the feature
   - Understand frontend data needs and user journeys
   - Identify business logic patterns and constraints

2. **Design Complete Architecture**
   - API design with consistent patterns
   - Service layer organization
   - Data access and caching strategies
   - Security and authorization approach

3. **Implementation Strategy**
   - Service build order for maximum testability
   - Database integration points
   - Performance optimization approach

4. **Quality Assurance**

```

### 3. Tech Lead Orchestrator Enhancement

Modify `tech-lead-orchestrator.md` to support domain-based assignment:

```markdown
## Domain-Based Task Assignment

### Assignment Strategy
Use domain-based assignments for multi-step features:

**Instead of task-by-task:**
```
Task 1: Create login API → backend-developer
Task 2: Create login form → frontend-developer
Task 3: Add user table → backend-developer
```

**Use domain-based:**
```
Frontend Domain: Complete authentication UI flow → frontend-domain-agent
Backend Domain: Complete authentication system → backend-domain-agent
Database Domain: User management schema → database-domain-agent
```

### Domain Assignment Rules

1. **Single Domain Features**: Assign entire feature to one domain agent
2. **Multi-Domain Features**: Assign domain-specific portions to respective agents
3. **Cross-Domain Integration**: Use sequential execution with clear interfaces
4. **Complex Features**: Use domain-based parallel execution

### Execution Patterns

**Sequential Domain Execution:**
```
Database Domain → Backend Domain → Frontend Domain
(Schema first, then services, then UI)
```

**Parallel Domain Execution:**
```
Database Domain: Schema design
Backend Domain: Service architecture design  
Frontend Domain: UI/UX design
→ Integration phase with all domains
```

### Domain Coordination
- Each domain agent provides interface specifications
- Integration checkpoints verify cross-domain compatibility
- Final integration testing validates complete feature
```

## Benefits of Domain-Based Approach

### For Development Efficiency
1. **Reduced Context Switching**: Agents maintain full domain context
2. **Pattern Consistency**: Single agent ensures consistent patterns within domain
3. **Faster Implementation**: No need to re-establish context each task
4. **Better Integration**: Agents understand cross-domain implications

### For Code Quality  
1. **Architectural Integrity**: Domain ownership prevents architectural drift
2. **Performance Optimization**: Agents can optimize across entire domain
3. **Testing Coverage**: Complete domain testing strategies
4. **Maintainability**: Consistent patterns ease maintenance

### For Project Management
1. **Clear Ownership**: Each domain has a single responsible agent
2. **Predictable Delivery**: Domain agents can estimate complete scope
3. **Parallel Development**: Domains can work independently with clear interfaces
4. **Risk Reduction**: Domain expertise reduces implementation risks
