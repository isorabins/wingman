# Task ID: 12
# Title: Challenges catalog and API
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Seed and expose GET /api/challenges with difficulty filter and metadata.
# Details:
- Populate approach_challenges per PRD with titles, descriptions, points.
- Implement GET /api/challenges?difficulty=... in FastAPI following route style in reference_files/src/main.py.
- Cache results in Redis for 10m following existing Redis usage patterns in reference_files/src/main.py.
- Add feature flag to add more later without deploy (config table).
- Include per-challenge tips surfaced by Connell via tool call.
- New endpoints should live alongside existing ones without changing references.

- Implement cache tagging system with 'challenges' tag for GET /api/challenges Redis cache
- Add support for manual cache invalidation via revalidateTag('challenges') for admin updates
- Include ETag header support in response for client-side caching if needed
- Keep cache invalidation implementation simple for MVP phase
