# Task ID: 25
# Title: Beta operations and feedback loop
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 17, 23, 24
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enable internal/beta cohort, collect feedback, and iterate quickly.
# Details:
- Beta invite codes; gate new signups.
- In-app feedback form after sessions; NPS-style and qualitative.
- Analytics: match acceptance, session completion, D7 retention; dashboards (based on patterns in reference_files/frontend_reference/FAF_website/README.md and CLAUDE.md).
- Prompt A/B testing harness for Connell responses.
- Changelog and release cadence 2-3 days.
- Implement invite gating and feedback collection in our codebase only, without modifying reference files.

# Test Strategy:
- Validate invite gating works.
- Ensure analytics events populate dashboards using lightweight testing approach.
- Run a 20-user beta; collect and triage issues within SLA.
