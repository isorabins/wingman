# Task ID: 18
# Title: Transform project_overview API→/api/dating-goals
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 4, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Repurpose project overview to dating goals with minimal changes, creating new endpoints without modifying reference files.
# Details:
- Copy reference_files/src/agents/project_overview_agent.py → src/agents/wingman_profile_agent.py and simplify to goals for dating
- Create new route /api/dating-goals in FastAPI per reference_files/src/main.py; do not modify existing project-overview route
- Adapt schema fields to goals for confidence building (targets, triggers, past attempts)
- Store in dating_goals table with same shape
- Integrate into Connell memory so coach references goals
- Link from assessment results page to optionally fill goals

# Test Strategy:
- API tests for CRUD operations on new endpoint
- Coach conversation references stored goals in responses in sandbox tests
- Verify original project-overview endpoint still works correctly
- Ensure new implementation doesn't interfere with existing code paths
